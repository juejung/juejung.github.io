Homework: OOP
=======================

Submit this homework in class on Tuesday.
I need two files:

  * R-scripts are submitted in one file called: ``Homework5.R``
  * Python-scripts are submitted in one file called: ``Homework5.py``

I need to be able to quickly run these scripts on my computer.

I will based your homework grade on my grading of 2 randomly selected homework exercises. So please make sure that you complete every homework 100% as you might otherwise end up with zero points.

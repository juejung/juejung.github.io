        * Discuss the importance of studying economics
        * Explain the relationship between production and division of labor
        * Evaluate the significance of scarcity

**Economics** is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity.
These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business decisions or
societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is
a fact of life. Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and
resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and
raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they
exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time-
everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 hours in the day to try to acquire the
goods they want. At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of
resources available.

Think about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the
United States contained over 158.6 million workers, according to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similarly, the total area of the United States is
3,794,101 square miles. These are large numbers for such crucial resources,
however, they are limited. Because these resources are limited, so are the
numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact
that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is
a problem.

If you still do not believe that **scarcity** is a problem, consider the following:
Does everyone need food to eat? Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does
everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there are
people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their
beds, as shown in :numref:`fig_bum_003`), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few
critical goods and services. Why is this the case? It is because of scarcity.
Let’s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial
to understanding economics.

.. The Problem of Scarcity {{{2
The Problem of Scarcity
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Think about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing,
transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those items?
You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things
you buy? You work for pay. Or if you do not, someone else does on your behalf.
Yet most of us never have enough to buy all the things we want. This is because
of scarcity. So how do we solve it?  Visit `this website

dealing with scarcity in resources.

.. The Division of and Specialization of Labor {{{2
The Division of and Specialization of Labor
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published his
famous book The Wealth of Nations in 1776. Many authors had written on
economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the
subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the
division of labor, which means that the way a good or service is produced is
divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers, instead
of all the tasks being done by the same person.

.. figure:: Graphs/ch1/CNX_Econ_C01_008.jpg

To illustrate the division of
labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece
of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on
one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a
few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that were often done by different
people—all for a pin, believe it or not!

Modern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like
a restaurant divides up the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top
chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a
greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle
paychecks and bills—not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has
with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it
is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the
shoe factory shown in :numref:`fig_shoeworkers_009`, or a hospital can have hundreds of job
classifications.

.. Why the Division of Labor Increases Production {{{2
Why the Division of Labor Increases Production
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the tasks involved with producing a good or service are divided and subdivided, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith observed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to do two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons.

First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, specialization will be affected by geography—it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more productive than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not.

Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better.

A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products.

Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity.

.. }}}2
.. Trade and Markets {{{2
Trade and Markets
+++++++++++++++++

Specialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they
receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they
need. In short, specialization requires trade.  You do not have to know
anything about electronics or sound systems to play music—you just buy an iPod
or MP3 player, download the music and listen. You do not have to know anything
about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a
jacket—you just buy the jacket and wear it.

You do not need to know anything
about internal combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and drive.
Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing
all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you
to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy
the goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has
evolved into a strong economy.

.. Why Study Economics? {{{2
Why Study Economics?
++++++++++++++++++++

Now that we have gotten an overview on what economics studies, let’s quickly
discuss why you are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a collection
of facts to be memorized, though there are plenty of important concepts to be
learned. Instead, economics is better thought of as a collection of questions
to be answered or puzzles to be worked out. Most important, economics provides
the tools to work out those puzzles. If you have yet to be been bitten by the
economics “bug,” there are other reasons why you should study economics.

    * Virtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to
      world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an
      economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those problems, you
      need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.

    * It is hard to
      overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able
      to vote intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the
      U.S. government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the
      “fiscal cliff,” what were the issues involved? Did you know?

    * A basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you
      read articles about economic issues, you will understand and be able to
      evaluate the writer’s argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or
      political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish
      between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about
      current events and about personal and business decisions, as well as current
      events and politics.

The study of economics does not dictate the answers, but
it can illuminate the different choices.

Key Concepts and Summary
++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. note:: Economics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human
    wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy
    displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in
    what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need
    or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and
    to produce more for several reasons:
        a. It allows the agents to focus on areas
           of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels;
        b. It encourages the
           agents to learn and invent;
        c. It allows agents to take advantage of economies
           of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can
           purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps
           you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a
           good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.

        * Describe microeconomics
        * Describe macroeconomics
        * Contrast monetary policy and fiscal policy

Economics is concerned with the well-being of all people, including those with
jobs and those without jobs, as well as those with high incomes and those with
low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and
services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the
question of how investing in education helps to develop workers’ skills. It
probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are
operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating
in a way that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It
looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about
production and consumption.

It should be clear by now that economics covers a
lot of ground. That ground can be divided into two parts: Microeconomics
focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like
households, workers, and businesses; Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a
whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of
unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits,
and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not
separate subjects, but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject
of the economy.

To understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the entire ecosystem of the lake from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint.

Whether you are looking at lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and animals live.

In economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy; for example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, the performance of the macroeconomy ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions made by individual households and businesses.

Microeconomics
++++++++++++++

What determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and services will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means?

What determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines what prices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many workers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close? In the microeconomic part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior and the theory of the firm.

.. }}}2
.. Macroeconomics {{{2
Macroeconomics
++++++++++++++

What determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods and services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What determines a nation’s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes firms to hire more workers or to lay workers off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term?

An economy's macroeconomic health can be defined by a number of goals: growth in the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals? Monetary policy, which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets, is conducted by a nation’s central bank. For the United States, this is the Federal Reserve. Fiscal policy, which involves government spending and taxes, is determined by a nation’s legislative body. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates the federal budget. These are the main tools the government has to work with. Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that will be explored in the macroeconomic chapters of this book... }}}2

   One of the most influential economists in modern times was John Maynard Keynes. (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)

John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), one of the greatest economists of the
twentieth century, pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but
also a way of thinking. Keynes, shown in :numref:`fig_Keynes_004`, famously wrote in the
introduction to a fellow economist’s book: “[Economics] is a method rather than
a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its
possessor to draw correct conclusions.” In other words, economics teaches you
how to think, not what to think.

Economists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any other discipline. They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior, that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other. The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to be understood, while complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation being studied.

Sometimes economists use the term model instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is more applied or empirical representation. Models are used to test theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.


For example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product will be, but can still demonstrate how the new product will work.

A good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram, which is
shown in :numref:`fig2_circFlow`. It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups—households
and firms—that interact in two markets: the goods and services market in which
firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell
labor to business firms or other employees.

        * Contrast traditional economies, command economies, and market economies
        * Explain gross domestic product (GDP)
        * Assess the importance and effects of globalization

Think about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this system? Who insures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants? Who insures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who insures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get done?

There are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy. The first is the traditional economy, which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the crops they have always grown using traditional methods. What you produce is what you get to consume. Because things are driven by tradition, there is little economic progress or development.

   Ancient Egypt was an example of a command economy. (Credit: Jay Bergesen/Flickr Creative Commons)

Command economies are very different. In a command economy, economic effort is
devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a
good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids,
like those shown in :numref:`fig_Egypt_005`, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another
example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the
event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the lord’s
bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies.

In a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be
produced and what prices will be charged for them. The government decides what
methods of production will be used and how much workers will be paid. Many
necessities like healthcare and education are provided for free. Currently,
Cuba and North Korea have command economies.

   Nothing says “market” more than The New York Stock Exchange. (Credit: Erik Drost/Flickr Creative Commons)

Although command economies have a very centralized structure for economic
decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A market is an
institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who
may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange, shown in
:numref:`fig_Wallstreet_006`, is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought
together. In a market economy, decision-making is decentralized. Market
economies are based on private enterprise: the means of production (resources
and businesses) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of
private individuals. Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In
a command economy, by contrast, resources and businesses are owned by the
government.) What goods and services are supplied depends on what is demanded.
A person’s income is based on his or her ability to convert resources
(especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values
the person’s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James).
In this scenario, economic decisions are determined by market forces, not
governments.

Most economies in the real world are mixed; they combine elements of command
and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned
toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and
Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of
government involvement in economic decisions than does the U.S. economy. China
and Russia, while they are closer to having a market-oriented system now than
several decades ago, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum.
A rich resource of information about countries and their economies can be found
on the Heritage Foundation’s website, as the following Clear It Up feature
discusses.

.. seealso:: WHAT COUNTRIES ARE CONSIDERED ECONOMICALLY FREE?

    Who is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive loans? Or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category.

    The 2015 Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178
    countries around the world: some examples of the most free and the least
    free countries are listed in :numref:`tab_EconFreedom`. Several countries were not ranked
    because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom
    impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Somalia.

    The assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a higher level of economic freedom around the world.

.. Regulations: The Rules of the Game {{{2
Regulations: The Rules of the Game
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Markets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated. Heavily regulated economies often have underground economies, which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government’s approval.

The question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a black-or-white choice between all market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules.

The Rise of Globalization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Recent decades have seen a trend toward globalization, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders—in other words, international trade and financial capital flows.

Globalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship shown in Figure, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information—for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade.

:numref:`tab_globalization` presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2013, according to an entity known as The World Bank. Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad. Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically. The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product (GDP). Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country’s total economic production is sold in other countries.

In recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries.

Table also shows that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with connections.

So, hopefully, you now have an idea of what economics is about. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to read the very important appendix to this chapter called The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics. It is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.

    The world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the Farmer’s Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop harvested.

    Some relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. Facebook post topics range from the National Basketball Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.

    Information helps us make decisions. Decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters should be sent to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If ten reporters are sent to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks. Information provides the knowledge needed to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics!

.. note:: Societies can be organized as traditional, command, or market-oriented economies. Most societies are a mix. The last few decades have seen globalization evolve as a result of growth in commercial and financial networks that cross national borders, making businesses and workers from different economies increasingly interdependent.

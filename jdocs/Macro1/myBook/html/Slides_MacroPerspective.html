<h1>Intro Macro Perspective<a class="headerlink" href="#intro-macro-perspective" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Macroeconomics focuses on the economy as a whole (or on whole economies as they
interact). What causes recessions? What makes unemployment stay high when
recessions are supposed to be over? Why do some countries grow faster than
others? Why do some countries have higher standards of living than others?
These are all questions that macroeconomics addresses. Macroeconomics involves
adding up the economic activity of all households and all businesses in all
markets to get the overall demand and supply in the economy. However, when we
do that, something curious happens. It is not unusual that what results at the
macro level is different from the sum of the microeconomic parts. Indeed, what
seems sensible from a microeconomic point of view can have unexpected or
counterproductive results at the macroeconomic level. Imagine that you are
sitting at an event with a large audience, like a live concert or a basketball
game. A few people decide that they want a better view, and so they stand up.
However, when these people stand up, they block the view for other people, and
the others need to stand up as well if they wish to see.  Eventually, nearly
everyone is standing up, and as a result, no one can see much better than
before. The rational decision of some individuals at the micro level—to stand
up for a better view—ended up being self-defeating at the macro level. This is
not macroeconomics, but it is an apt analogy.</p>
<p>Macroeconomics is a rather massive subject. How are we going to tackle it?
We will study macroeconomics from three different perspectives:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What are the macroeconomic goals? (Macroeconomics as a discipline does not have goals, but we do have
goals for the macro economy.)</li>
<li>What are the frameworks economists can use to analyze the macroeconomy?</li>
<li>Finally, what are the policy tools governments can use to manage the macroeconomy?</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Goals</strong></p>
<p>In thinking about the overall health of the macroeconomy, it is useful to consider three primary goals: economic
growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Economic growth ultimately determines the prevailing standard of living in a country. Economic growth is
measured by the percentage change in real (inflation-adjusted) gross domestic product. A growth rate of more
than 3% is considered good.</li>
<li>Unemployment, as measured by the unemployment rate, is the percentage of people in the labor force who
do not have a job. When people lack jobs, the economy is wasting a precious resource-labor, and the result is</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Frameworks</strong></p>
<p>As you learn in the micro part of this book, principal tools used by economists
are theories and models (see Welcome to Economics! for more on this). In
microeconomics, we used the theories of supply and demand; in macroeconomics,
we use the theories of aggregate demand (AD) and aggregate supply (AS). This
book presents two perspectives on macroeconomics: the Neoclassical perspective
and the Keynesian perspective, each of which has its own version of AD and AS.
Between the two perspectives, you will obtain a good understanding of what
drives the macroeconomy.</p>
<p><strong>Policy Tools</strong></p>
<p>National governments have two tools for influencing the macroeconomy. The first
is monetary policy, which involves managing the money supply and interest
rates. The second is fiscal policy, which involves changes in government
spending/purchases and taxes.  Each of the items in Figure will be explained in
detail in one or more other chapters. As you learn these things, you will
discover that the goals and the policy tools are in the news almost every day.</p>

<h2>Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product<a class="headerlink" href="#measuring-the-size-of-the-economy-gross-domestic-product" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Macroeconomics is an empirical subject, so the first step toward understanding it is to measure the economy.
How large is the U.S. economy? The size of a nation’s overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year. The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services—smart phones, cars, music downloads, computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other new goods and services produced in the current year—and summing them into a total dollar value. This task is straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply it by the price at which each product sold, and add up the total. In 2014, the U.S. GDP totaled $17.4 trillion, the largest GDP in the world.
Each of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve both a buyer and a seller. The GDP of an economy can be measured either by the total dollar value of what is purchased in the economy, or by the total dollar value of what is produced. There is even a third way, as we will explain later.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Services are the largest single component of total supply, representing over half of GDP. Nondurable goods used to be larger than durable goods, but in recent years, nondurable goods have been dropping closer to durable goods, which is about 20% of GDP. Structures hover around 10% of GDP. The change in inventories, the final component of aggregate supply, is not shown here; it is typically less than 1% of GDP.</span></p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>WHAT IS MEANT BY THE WORD “INVESTMENT”?</p>
<p class="last">What do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In calculating GDP, investment does not refer to the purchase of stocks and bonds or the trading of financial assets. It refers to the purchase of new capital goods, that is, new commercial real estate (such as buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing construction, and inventories. Inventories that are produced this year are included in this year’s GDP—even if they have not yet sold. From the accountant’s perspective, it is as if the firm invested in its own inventories. Business investment in 2014 was almost $3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p>

<h3>Key Concepts and Summary<a class="headerlink" href="#key-concepts-and-summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The size of a nation’s economy is commonly expressed as its gross
domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of the output of all goods and
services produced within the country in a year. GDP is measured by taking the
quantities of all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their
prices, and summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought and sold in
the economy, it can be measured either by the sum of what is purchased in the
economy or what is produced.  Demand can be divided into consumption,
investment, government, exports, and imports. What is produced in the economy
can be divided into durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and
inventories. To avoid double counting, GDP counts only final output of goods
and services, not the production of intermediate goods or the value of labor in
the chain of production.</p>

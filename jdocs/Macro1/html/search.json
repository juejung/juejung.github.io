    "text": "1.1 What Economics Is and Why It’s Important\nEconomics is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity. These can be individual decisions, family decisions, business decisions or societal decisions. If you look around carefully, you will see that scarcity is a fact of life. Scarcity means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available. Resources, such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply. Of course, the ultimate scarce resource is time-everyone, rich or poor, has just 24 hours in the day to try to acquire the goods they want. At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available.\nThink about it this way: In 2015 the labor force in the United States contained over 158.6 million workers, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Similarly, the total area of the United States is 3,794,101 square miles. These are large numbers for such crucial resources, however, they are limited. Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them. Combine this with the fact that human wants seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem.\nIf you still do not believe that scarcity is a problem, consider the following: Does everyone need food to eat? Does everyone need a decent place to live? Does everyone have access to healthcare? In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless (for example, those who call park benches their beds, as shown in Figure 1.1), and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services. Why is this the case? It is because of scarcity. Let’s delve into the concept of scarcity a little deeper, because it is crucial to understanding economics.",

(Credit: “daveynin”/Flickr Creative Commons)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.1 The Problem of Scarcity\nThink about all the things you consume: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment. How do you acquire those items? You do not produce them yourself. You buy them. How do you afford the things you buy? You work for pay. Or if you do not, someone else does on your behalf. Yet most of us never have enough to buy all the things we want. This is because of scarcity. So how do we solve it? Visit this website to read about how the United States is dealing with scarcity in resources.\n\n\n1.1.2 The Division of and Specialization of Labor\nThe formal study of economics began when Adam Smith (1723–1790) published his famous book The Wealth of Nations in 1776. Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way. In the first chapter, Smith introduces the division of labor, which means that the way a good or service is produced is divided into a number of tasks that are performed by different workers, instead of all the tasks being done by the same person.\n\n\n\nAdam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks. (Credit: Wikimedia Commons)\n\n\nTo illustrate the division of labor, Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin: drawing out a piece of wire, cutting it to the right length, straightening it, putting a head on one end and a point on the other, and packaging pins for sale, to name just a few. Smith counted 18 distinct tasks that were often done by different people—all for a pin, believe it or not!\nModern businesses divide tasks as well. Even a relatively simple business like a restaurant divides up the task of serving meals into a range of jobs like top chef, sous chefs, less-skilled kitchen help, servers to wait on the tables, a greeter at the door, janitors to clean up, and a business manager to handle paychecks and bills—not to mention the economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers of food, furniture, kitchen equipment, and the building where it is located. A complex business like a large manufacturing factory, such as the shoe factory shown in Figure 1.2, or a hospital can have hundreds of job classifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Workers on an assembly line are an example of the divisions of labor. (Credit: Nina Hale/Flickr Creative Commons)\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Why the Division of Labor Increases Production\nWhen the tasks involved with producing a good or service are divided and subdivided, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith observed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to do two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? Smith offered three reasons.\nFirst, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, specialization will be affected by geography—it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more productive than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not.\nSecond, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better.\nA similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products.\nThird, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. The ultimate result of workers who can focus on their preferences and talents, learn to do their specialized jobs better, and work in larger organizations is that society as a whole can produce and consume far more than if each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services. The division and specialization of labor has been a force against the problem of scarcity.\n\n\n1.1.4 Trade and Markets\nSpecialization only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need. In short, specialization requires trade. You do not have to know anything about electronics or sound systems to play music—you just buy an iPod or MP3 player, download the music and listen. You do not have to know anything about artificial fibers or the construction of sewing machines if you need a jacket—you just buy the jacket and wear it.\nYou do not need to know anything about internal combustion engines to operate a car—you just get in and drive. Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the market allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want. This is how our modern society has evolved into a strong economy.\n\n\n1.1.5 Why Study Economics?\nNow that we have gotten an overview on what economics studies, let’s quickly discuss why you are right to study it. Economics is not primarily a collection of facts to be memorized, though there are plenty of important concepts to be learned. Instead, economics is better thought of as a collection of questions to be answered or puzzles to be worked out. Most important, economics provides the tools to work out those puzzles. If you have yet to be been bitten by the economics “bug,” there are other reasons why you should study economics.\n\nVirtually every major problem facing the world today, from global warming, to world poverty, to the conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, and Somalia, has an economic dimension. If you are going to be part of solving those problems, you need to be able to understand them. Economics is crucial.\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of economics to good citizenship. You need to be able to vote intelligently on budgets, regulations, and laws in general. When the U.S. government came close to a standstill at the end of 2012 due to the “fiscal cliff,” what were the issues involved? Did you know?\nA basic understanding of economics makes you a well-rounded thinker. When you read articles about economic issues, you will understand and be able to evaluate the writer’s argument. When you hear classmates, co-workers, or political candidates talking about economics, you will be able to distinguish between common sense and nonsense. You will find new ways of thinking about current events and about personal and business decisions, as well as current events and politics.\n\nThe study of economics does not dictate the answers, but it can illuminate the different choices.\n\n\n1.1.6 Positive versus Normative Analysis\nMost modern economics is based on positive analysis, which predicts the consequences of alternative actions by answering the question “What is?” or “What will be?”\nA second type of economic reasoning is normative in nature. Normative analysis answers the question “What ought to be?”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPositive Questions\nNormative Questions\n\n\n\n\nIf the government increases the minimum\nwage, how many workers will lose their\njobs?\nShould the government\nincrease the minimum\nwage?\n\n\nIf two office supply firms merge,\nwill the price of office supplies\nincrease\nShould the government block\nthe merger of two office\nsupply stores?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\nEconomics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply. A modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want. The division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a. It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b. It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c. It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is scarcity? Can you think of two causes of scarcity?\nResidents of the town of Smithfield like to consume hams, but each ham requires 10 people to produce it and takes a month. If the town has a total of 100 people, what is the maximum amount of ham the residents can consume in a month?\nA consultant works for $200 per hour. She likes to eat vegetables, but is not very good at growing them. Why does it make more economic sense for her to spend her time at the consulting job and shop for her vegetables?\nA computer systems engineer could paint his house, but it makes more sense for him to hire a painter to do it. Explain why.",

    "text": "1.2 Microeconomics and Macroeconomics\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nDescribe microeconomics\nDescribe macroeconomics\nContrast monetary policy and fiscal policy\n\n\n\nEconomics is concerned with the well-being of all people, including those with jobs and those without jobs, as well as those with high incomes and those with low incomes. Economics acknowledges that production of useful goods and services can create problems of environmental pollution. It explores the question of how investing in education helps to develop workers’ skills. It probes questions like how to tell when big businesses or big labor unions are operating in a way that benefits society as a whole and when they are operating in a way that benefits their owners or members at the expense of others. It looks at how government spending, taxes, and regulations affect decisions about production and consumption.\nIt should be clear by now that economics covers a lot of ground. That ground can be divided into two parts: Microeconomics focuses on the actions of individual agents within the economy, like households, workers, and businesses; Macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole. It focuses on broad issues such as growth of production, the number of unemployed people, the inflationary increase in prices, government deficits, and levels of exports and imports. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are not separate subjects, but rather complementary perspectives on the overall subject of the economy.\nTo understand why both microeconomic and macroeconomic perspectives are useful, consider the problem of studying a biological ecosystem like a lake. One person who sets out to study the lake might focus on specific topics: certain kinds of algae or plant life; the characteristics of particular fish or snails; or the trees surrounding the lake. Another person might take an overall view and instead consider the entire ecosystem of the lake from top to bottom; what eats what, how the system stays in a rough balance, and what environmental stresses affect this balance. Both approaches are useful, and both examine the same lake, but the viewpoints are different. In a similar way, both microeconomics and macroeconomics study the same economy, but each has a different viewpoint.\nWhether you are looking at lakes or economics, the micro and the macro insights should blend with each other. In studying a lake, the micro insights about particular plants and animals help to understand the overall food chain, while the macro insights about the overall food chain help to explain the environment in which individual plants and animals live.\nIn economics, the micro decisions of individual businesses are influenced by whether the macroeconomy is healthy; for example, firms will be more likely to hire workers if the overall economy is growing. In turn, the performance of the macroeconomy ultimately depends on the microeconomic decisions made by individual households and businesses.\n\n1.2.1 Microeconomics\nWhat determines how households and individuals spend their budgets? What combination of goods and services will best fit their needs and wants, given the budget they have to spend? How do people decide whether to work, and if so, whether to work full time or part time? How do people decide how much to save for the future, or whether they should borrow to spend beyond their current means?\nWhat determines the products, and how many of each, a firm will produce and sell? What determines what prices a firm will charge? What determines how a firm will produce its products? What determines how many workers it will hire? How will a firm finance its business? When will a firm decide to expand, downsize, or even close? In the microeconomic part of this book, we will learn about the theory of consumer behavior and the theory of the firm.\n\n\n1.2.2 Macroeconomics\nWhat determines the level of economic activity in a society? In other words, what determines how many goods and services a nation actually produces? What determines how many jobs are available in an economy? What determines a nation’s standard of living? What causes the economy to speed up or slow down? What causes firms to hire more workers or to lay workers off? Finally, what causes the economy to grow over the long term?\nAn economy’s macroeconomic health can be defined by a number of goals: growth in the standard of living, low unemployment, and low inflation, to name the most important. How can macroeconomic policy be used to pursue these goals? Monetary policy, which involves policies that affect bank lending, interest rates, and financial capital markets, is conducted by a nation’s central bank. For the United States, this is the Federal Reserve. Fiscal policy, which involves government spending and taxes, is determined by a nation’s legislative body. For the United States, this is the Congress and the executive branch, which originates the federal budget. These are the main tools the government has to work with. Americans tend to expect that government can fix whatever economic problems we encounter, but to what extent is that expectation realistic? These are just some of the issues that will be explored in the macroeconomic chapters of this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\nMicroeconomics and macroeconomics are two different perspectives on the economy.\nThe microeconomic perspective focuses on parts of the economy: individuals, firms, and industries.\nThe macroeconomic perspective looks at the economy as a whole, focusing on goals like growth in the standard of living, unemployment, and inflation. Macroeconomics has two types of policies for pursuing these goals: monetary policy and fiscal policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would be another example of a “system” in the real world that could serve as a metaphor for micro and macroeconomics?\nWhat is the difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics?\nWhat are examples of individual economic agents?\nWhat are the three main goals of macroeconomics?",

(Credit: Wikimedia Commons)\n\n\n\nJohn Maynard Keynes (1883–1946), one of the greatest economists of the twentieth century, pointed out that economics is not just a subject area but also a way of thinking. Keynes, shown in Figure 1.3, famously wrote in the introduction to a fellow economist’s book: “[Economics] is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a technique of thinking, which helps its possessor to draw correct conclusions.” In other words, economics teaches you how to think, not what to think.\nEconomists see the world through a different lens than anthropologists, biologists, classicists, or practitioners of any other discipline. They analyze issues and problems with economic theories that are based on particular assumptions about human behavior, that are different than the assumptions an anthropologist or psychologist might use. A theory is a simplified representation of how two or more variables interact with each other. The purpose of a theory is to take a complex, real-world issue and simplify it down to its essentials. If done well, this enables the analyst to understand the issue and any problems around it. A good theory is simple enough to be understood, while complex enough to capture the key features of the object or situation being studied.\nSometimes economists use the term model instead of theory. Strictly speaking, a theory is a more abstract representation, while a model is more applied or empirical representation. Models are used to test theories, but for this course we will use the terms interchangeably.\nFor example, an architect who is planning a major office building will often build a physical model that sits on a tabletop to show how the entire city block will look after the new building is constructed. Companies often build models of their new products, which are more rough and unfinished than the final product will be, but can still demonstrate how the new product will work.\nA good model to start with in economics is the circular flow diagram, which is shown in Figure 1.4. It pictures the economy as consisting of two groups—households and firms—that interact in two markets: the goods and services market in which firms sell and households buy and the labor market in which households sell labor to business firms or other employees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: Circular Flow Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\nEconomists analyze problems differently than do other disciplinary experts. The main tools economists use are economic theories or models. A theory is not an illustration of the answer to a problem. Rather, a theory is a tool for determining the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we extend the circular flow model to add imports and exports. Copy the circular flow diagram onto a sheet of paper and then add a foreign country as a third agent. Draw a rough sketch of the flows of imports, exports, and the payments for each on your diagram.\nWhat is an example of a problem in the world today, not mentioned in the chapter, that has an economic dimension?",

    "text": "1.4 How Economies Can Be Organized: An Overview of Economic Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nContrast traditional economies, command economies, and market economies\nExplain gross domestic product (GDP)\nAssess the importance and effects of globalization\n\n\n\nThink about what a complex system a modern economy is. It includes all production of goods and services, all buying and selling, all employment. The economic life of every individual is interrelated, at least to a small extent, with the economic lives of thousands or even millions of other individuals. Who organizes and coordinates this system? Who insures that, for example, the number of televisions a society provides is the same as the amount it needs and wants? Who insures that the right number of employees work in the electronics industry? Who insures that televisions are produced in the best way possible? How does it all get done?\nThere are at least three ways societies have found to organize an economy. The first is the traditional economy, which is the oldest economic system and can be found in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America. Traditional economies organize their economic affairs the way they have always done (i.e., tradition). Occupations stay in the family. Most families are farmers who grow the crops they have always grown using traditional methods. What you produce is what you get to consume. Because things are driven by tradition, there is little economic progress or development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: Ancient Egypt was an example of a command economy. (Credit: Jay Bergesen/Flickr Creative Commons)\n\n\n\nCommand economies are very different. In a command economy, economic effort is devoted to goals passed down from a ruler or ruling class. Ancient Egypt was a good example: a large part of economic life was devoted to building pyramids, like those shown in Figure 1.5, for the pharaohs. Medieval manor life is another example: the lord provided the land for growing crops and protection in the event of war. In return, vassals provided labor and soldiers to do the lord’s bidding. In the last century, communism emphasized command economies.\nIn a command economy, the government decides what goods and services will be produced and what prices will be charged for them. The government decides what methods of production will be used and how much workers will be paid. Many necessities like healthcare and education are provided for free. Currently, Cuba and North Korea have command economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Nothing says “market” more than The New York Stock Exchange. (Credit: Erik Drost/Flickr Creative Commons)\n\n\n\nAlthough command economies have a very centralized structure for economic decisions, market economies have a very decentralized structure. A market is an institution that brings together buyers and sellers of goods or services, who may be either individuals or businesses. The New York Stock Exchange, shown in Figure 1.6, is a prime example of market in which buyers and sellers are brought together. In a market economy, decision-making is decentralized. Market economies are based on private enterprise: the means of production (resources and businesses) are owned and operated by private individuals or groups of private individuals. Businesses supply goods and services based on demand. (In a command economy, by contrast, resources and businesses are owned by the government.) What goods and services are supplied depends on what is demanded. A person’s income is based on his or her ability to convert resources (especially labor) into something that society values. The more society values the person’s output, the higher the income (think Lady Gaga or LeBron James). In this scenario, economic decisions are determined by market forces, not governments.\nMost economies in the real world are mixed; they combine elements of command and market (and even traditional) systems. The U.S. economy is positioned toward the market-oriented end of the spectrum. Many countries in Europe and Latin America, while primarily market-oriented, have a greater degree of government involvement in economic decisions than does the U.S. economy. China and Russia, while they are closer to having a market-oriented system now than several decades ago, remain closer to the command economy end of the spectrum. A rich resource of information about countries and their economies can be found on the Heritage Foundation’s website, as the following Clear It Up feature discusses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\nWHAT COUNTRIES ARE CONSIDERED ECONOMICALLY FREE?\nWho is in control of economic decisions? Are people free to do what they want and to work where they want? Are businesses free to produce when they want and what they choose, and to hire and fire as they wish? Are banks free to choose who will receive loans? Or does the government control these kinds of choices? Each year, researchers at the Heritage Foundation and the Wall Street Journal look at 50 different categories of economic freedom for countries around the world. They give each nation a score based on the extent of economic freedom in each category.\nThe 2015 Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic Freedom report ranked 178 countries around the world: some examples of the most free and the least free countries are listed in Table 1.1. Several coguntries were not ranked because of extreme instability that made judgments about economic freedom impossible. These countries include Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Somalia.\nThe assigned rankings are inevitably based on estimates, yet even these rough measures can be useful for discerning trends. In 2015, 101 of the 178 included countries shifted toward greater economic freedom, although 77 of the countries shifted toward less economic freedom. In recent decades, the overall trend has been a higher level of economic freedom around the world.\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Economic Freedom Rankings\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Economic Freedom\nLeast Economic Freedom\n\n\n\n\n\nHong Kong\nSingapore\nNew Zealand\nAustralia\nSwitzerland\nCanada\nChile\nEstonia\nIreland\nMauritius\nDenmark\nUnited States\n\n\nTimor-Leste\nDemocratic Republic of Congo\nArgentina\nRepublic of Congo\nIran\nTurkmenistan\nEquatorial Guinea\nEritrea\nZimbabwe\nVenezuela\nCuba\nNorth Korea\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.4.1 Regulations: The Rules of the Game\nMarkets and government regulations are always entangled. There is no such thing as an absolutely free market. Regulations always define the “rules of the game” in the economy. Economies that are primarily market-oriented have fewer regulations—ideally just enough to maintain an even playing field for participants. At a minimum, these laws govern matters like safeguarding private property against theft, protecting people from violence, enforcing legal contracts, preventing fraud, and collecting taxes. Conversely, even the most command-oriented economies operate using markets. How else would buying and selling occur? But the decisions of what will be produced and what prices will be charged are heavily regulated. Heavily regulated economies often have underground economies, which are markets where the buyers and sellers make transactions without the government’s approval.\nThe question of how to organize economic institutions is typically not a black-or-white choice between all market or all government, but instead involves a balancing act over the appropriate combination of market freedom and government rules.\n\n\n1.4.2 The Rise of Globalization\nRecent decades have seen a trend toward globalization, which is the expanding cultural, political, and economic connections between people around the world. One measure of this is the increased buying and selling of goods, services, and assets across national borders—in other words, international trade and financial capital flows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Container Ship - A Symbol of Globalization\n\n\n\nGlobalization has occurred for a number of reasons. Improvements in shipping, as illustrated by the container ship shown in Figure 1.7, and air cargo have driven down transportation costs. Innovations in computing and telecommunications have made it easier and cheaper to manage long-distance economic connections of production and sales. Many valuable products and services in the modern economy can take the form of information—for example: computer software; financial advice; travel planning; music, books and movies; and blueprints for designing a building. These products and many others can be transported over telephones and computer networks at ever-lower costs. Finally, international agreements and treaties between countries have encouraged greater trade.\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: The Extent of Globalization (exports/GDP) (Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n\n\n\n\nHigher Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS\n12.4\n13.6\n13.6\n13.5\n\n\nBelgium\n76.2\n81.4\n82.2\n82.8\n\n\nCanada\n29.1\n30.7\n30.0\n30.1\n\n\nFrance\n26.0\n27.8\n28.1\n28.3\n\n\nMiddle Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrazil\n10.9\n11.9\n12.6\n12.6\n\n\nMexico\n29.9\n31.2\n32.6\n31.7\n\n\nS.Korea\n49.4\n55.7\n56.3\n53.9\n\n\nLower Income\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChad\n36.8\n38.9\n36.9\n32.2\n\n\nChina\n29.4\n28.5\n27.3\n26.4\n\n\nIndia\n22.0\n23.9\n24.0\n24.8\n\n\nNigeria\n25.3\n31.3\n31.4\n18.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2 presents one measure of globalization. It shows the percentage of domestic economic production that was exported for a selection of countries from 2010 to 2013, according to an entity known as The World Bank. Exports are the goods and services that are produced domestically and sold abroad. Imports are the goods and services that are produced abroad and then sold domestically. The size of total production in an economy is measured by the gross domestic product (GDP). Thus, the ratio of exports divided by GDP measures what share of a country’s total economic production is sold in other countries.\nIn recent decades, the export/GDP ratio has generally risen, both worldwide and for the U.S. economy. Interestingly, the share of U.S. exports in proportion to the U.S. economy is well below the global average, in part because large economies like the United States can contain more of the division of labor inside their national borders. However, smaller economies like Belgium, Korea, and Canada need to trade across their borders with other countries to take full advantage of division of labor, specialization, and economies of scale. In this sense, the enormous U.S. economy is less affected by globalization than most other countries.\nTable also shows that many medium and low income countries around the world, like Mexico and China, have also experienced a surge of globalization in recent decades. If an astronaut in orbit could put on special glasses that make all economic transactions visible as brightly colored lines and look down at Earth, the astronaut would see the planet covered with connections.\nSo, hopefully, you now have an idea of what economics is about. Before you move to any other chapter of study, be sure to read the very important appendix to this chapter called The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics. It is essential that you learn more about how to read and use models in economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\n\n\nNew Technology\nThe world we live in today provides nearly instant access to a wealth of information. Consider that as recently as the late 1970s, the Farmer’s Almanac, along with the Weather Bureau of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were the primary sources American farmers used to determine when to plant and harvest their crops. Today, farmers are more likely to access, online, weather forecasts from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or watch the Weather Channel. After all, knowing the upcoming forecast could drive when to harvest crops. Consequently, knowing the upcoming weather could change the amount of crop harvested.\nSome relatively new information forums, such as Facebook, are rapidly changing how information is distributed; hence, influencing decision making. In 2014, the Pew Research Center reported that 71% of online adults use Facebook. Facebook post topics range from the National Basketball Association, to celebrity singers and performers, to farmers.\nInformation helps us make decisions. Decisions as simple as what to wear today to how many reporters should be sent to cover a crash. Each of these decisions is an economic decision. After all, resources are scarce. If ten reporters are sent to cover an accident, they are not available to cover other stories or complete other tasks. Information provides the knowledge needed to make the best possible decisions on how to utilize scarce resources. Welcome to the world of economics!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\nSocieties can be organized as traditional, command, or market-oriented economies. Most societies are a mix. The last few decades have seen globalization evolve as a result of growth in commercial and financial networks that cross national borders, making businesses and workers from different economies increasingly interdependent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chapter defines private enterprise as a characteristic of market-oriented economies. What would public enterprise be? Hint: It is a characteristic of command economies.\nWhy might Belgium, France, Italy, and Sweden have a higher export to GDP ratio than the United States?",

    "text": "2.1 Algebraic Models\nOften economic models (or parts of models) are expressed in terms of mathematical functions. What is a function? A function describes a relationship. Sometimes the relationship is a definition. For example (using words), your professor is Adam Smith. This could be expressed as Professor = Adam Smith. Or Friends = Bob + Shawn + Margaret.\nOften in economics, functions describe cause and effect. The variable on the left-hand side is what is being explained (“the effect”). On the right-hand side is what is doing the explaining (“the causes”). For example, suppose your GPA was determined as follows:\n\\[\\text{GPA} = 0.25\\times\\text{combined-SAT}+0.25\\times\\text{class-attendance}+0.50\\times\\text{hours-spent-studying}\\]\nThis equation states that your GPA depends on three things: your combined SAT score, your class attendance, and the number of hours you spend studying.\nIt also says that study time is twice as important (0.50) as either combined_SAT score (0.25) or class_attendance (0.25). If this relationship is true, how could you raise your GPA? By not skipping class and studying more. Note that you cannot do anything about your SAT score, since if you are in college, you have (presumably) already taken the SATs.\nOf course, economic models express relationships using economic variables, like Budget = money_spent_on_econ_books + money_spent_on_music, assuming that the only things you buy are economics books and music.\nMost of the relationships we use in this course are expressed as linear equations of the form:\n\\[y = b + m \\times x\\]",

The first is to express equations visually, and the second is to display statistics or data. This section will discuss expressing equations visually.\nTo a mathematician or an economist, a variable is the name given to a quantity that may assume a range of values. In the equation of a line presented above, x and y are the variables, with x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis, and b and m representing factors that determine the shape of the line. To see how this equation works, consider a numerical example:\n\\[y = 9 + 3 \\times x\\]\nIn this equation for a specific line, the b term has been set equal to 9 and the m term has been set equal to 3. Table 2.1 shows the values of x and y for this given equation. Figure 2.1 shows this equation, and these values, in a graph. To construct the table, just plug in a series of different values for x, and then calculate what value of y results. In Figure 2.1, these points are plotted and a line is drawn through them.\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Values for the Slope Intercept Equation\n\n\n\n\n\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\n0\n9\n\n\n1\n12\n\n\n2\n15\n\n\n3\n18\n\n\n4\n21\n\n\n5\n24\n\n\n6\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Slope and the Algebra of Straight Lines. This line graph has x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis. The y-intercept—that is, the point where the line intersects the y-axis—is 9. The slope of the line is 3; that is, there is a rise of 3 on the vertical axis for every increase of 1 on the horizontal axis. The slope is the same all along a straight line.\n\n\n\nThe line graph shows the following approximate points: (0, 9); (1, 12); (2, 15); (3, 18); (4, 21); (5, 24); (6, 27).\nThis example illustrates how the b and m terms in an equation for a straight line determine the shape of the line. The b term is called the y-intercept. The reason for this name is that, if x = 0, then the b term will reveal where the line intercepts, or crosses, the y-axis. In this example, the line hits the vertical axis at 9. The m term in the equation for the line is the slope.\nRemember that slope is defined as rise over run; more specifically, the slope of a line from one point to another is the change in the vertical axis divided by the change in the horizontal axis. In this example, each time the x term increases by one (the run), the y term rises by three. Thus, the slope of this line is three. Specifying a y-intercept and a slope—that is, specifying b and m in the equation for a line—will identify a specific line. Although it is rare for real-world data points to arrange themselves as an exact straight line, it often turns out that a straight line can offer a reasonable approximation of actual data.\n\n\n2.1.2 Interpreting the Slope\nThe concept of slope is very useful in economics, because it measures the relationship between two variables. A positive slope means that two variables are positively related; that is, when x increases, so does y, or when x decreases, y decreases also. Graphically, a positive slope means that as a line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line rises. The length-weight relationship, shown in Figure 2.3 later in this Appendix, has a positive slope. We will learn in other chapters that price and quantity supplied have a positive relationship; that is, firms will supply more when the price is higher.\nA negative slope means that two variables are negatively related; that is, when x increases, y decreases, or when x decreases, y increases. Graphically, a negative slope means that, as the line on the line graph moves from left to right, the line falls. The altitude-air density relationship, shown in Figure 2.4 later in this appendix, has a negative slope. We will learn that price and quantity demanded have a negative relationship; that is, consumers will purchase less when the price is higher.\nA slope of zero means that there is no relationship between x and y. Graphically, the line is flat; that is, zero rise over the run. Figure 2.5 of the unemployment rate, shown later in this appendix, illustrates a common pattern of many line graphs: some segments where the slope is positive, other segments where the slope is negative, and still other segments where the slope is close to zero.\nThe slope of a straight line between two points can be calculated in numerical terms. To calculate slope, begin by designating one point as the “starting point” and the other point as the “end point” and then calculating the rise over run between these two points. As an example, consider the slope of the air density graph between the points representing an altitude of 4,000 meters and an altitude of 6,000 meters:\n\nRise:\n\nChange in variable on vertical axis (end point minus original point)\n\\[= 0.100 – 0.307 = –0.207\\]\n\nRun:\n\nChange in variable on horizontal axis (end point minus original point)\n\\[= 6,000 – 4,000= 2,000\\]\n\n\nThus, the slope of a straight line between these two points would be that from the altitude of 4,000 meters up to 6,000 meters, the density of the air decreases by approximately 0.1 kilograms/cubic meter for each of the next 1,000 meters.\nSuppose the slope of a line were to increase. Graphically, that means it would get steeper. Suppose the slope of a line were to decrease. Then it would get flatter. These conditions are true whether or not the slope was positive or negative to begin with. A higher positive slope means a steeper upward tilt to the line, while a smaller positive slope means a flatter upward tilt to the line. A negative slope that is larger in absolute value (that is, more negative) means a steeper downward tilt to the line. A slope of zero is a horizontal flat line. A vertical line has an infinite slope.\nSuppose a line has a larger intercept. Graphically, that means it would shift out (or up) from the old origin, parallel to the old line. If a line has a smaller intercept, it would shift in (or down), parallel to the old line.\n\n\n2.1.3 Solving Models with Algebra\nEconomists often use models to answer a specific question, like: What will the unemployment rate be if the economy grows at 3% per year? Answering specific questions requires solving the “system” of equations that represent the model.\nSuppose the demand for personal pizzas is given by the following equation:\n\\[Q_d = 16 – 2 \\times P\\]\nwhere \\(Q_d\\) is the amount of personal pizzas consumers want to buy (i.e., quantity demanded), and P is the price of pizzas. Suppose the supply of personal pizzas is:\n\\[Q_s = 2 + 5 \\times P\\]\nwhere \\(Q_s\\) is the amount of pizza producers will supply (i.e., quantity supplied).\nFinally, suppose that the personal pizza market operates where supply equals demand, or\n\\[Q_d = Q_s\\]\nWe now have a system of three equations and three unknowns (\\(Q_d\\), \\(Q_s\\), and P), which we can solve with algebra:\nSince \\(Q_d = Q_s\\), we can set the demand and supply equation equal to each other:\n\\[Q_d = Q_s\\]\n\\[16 – 2 \\times P = 2 + 5 \\times P\\]\nSubtracting 2 from both sides and adding 2P to both sides yields:\n\\[16 – 2 \\times P – 2 = 2 + 5 \\times P – 2\\]\n\\[14 – 2 \\times P = 5 \\times P\\]\n\\[14 – 2 \\times P + 2 \\times P = 5 \\times P + 2 \\times P\\]\n\\[14 = 7 \\times P\\]\n\\[P = 2\\]\nIn other words, the price of each personal pizza will be $2. How much will consumers buy?\nTaking the price of $2, and plugging it into the demand equation, we get:\n\\[Q_d = 16 – 2 \\times P\\]\n\\[Q_d = 16 – 2 \\times 2 = 16 – 4 = 12\\]\nSo if the price is $2 each, consumers will purchase 12. How much will producers supply? Taking the price of $2, and plugging it into the supply equation, we get:\n\\[Q_s = 2 + 5 \\times P\\]\n\\[Q_s = 2 + 5 \\times 2 = 2 + 10 = 12\\]\nSo if the price is $2 each, producers will supply 12 personal pizzas. This means we did our math correctly, since \\(Q_d = Q_s\\).\n\n\n2.1.4 Solving Models with Graphs\nIf algebra is not your forte, you can get the same answer by using graphs. Take the equations for \\(Q_d\\) and \\(Q_s\\) and graph them on the same set of axes as shown in Figure 2.2.\nSince P is on the vertical axis, it is easiest if you solve each equation for P. The demand curve is then \\(P = 8 – 0.5 \\times Q_d\\) and the demand curve is \\(P = –0.4 + 0.2 \\times Q_s\\). Note that the vertical intercepts are 8 and –0.4, and the slopes are –0.5 for demand and 0.2 for supply.\nIf you draw the graphs carefully, you will see that where they cross (\\(Q_s = Q_d\\)), the price is $2 and the quantity is 12, just like the algebra predicted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Supply and Demand Graph. The equations for \\(Q_d\\) and \\(Q_s\\) are displayed graphically by the sloped lines.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows a downward sloping demand curve with endpoints (0, 8) and (16, 0), and an upward sloping supply curve. The demand curve and supply curve intersect at point (12, 2).\nWe will use graphs more frequently in this book than algebra, but now you know the math behind the graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nLinear models, intercept and slope\nDrawing lines into a x/y coordinate system\nEquilibrium concept: Demand = Supply\nCalculating where 2 lines cross\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw this demand \\(P = 10 - 2.5 \\times Q\\)\nDraw this supply \\(P = 1 + 0.5 \\times Q\\)\nCalculate the equilibrium point and draw it into a graph",

    "text": "2.2 Growth Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nGrowth rates\nPercentage change\n\n\n\nGrowth rates are frequently encountered in real world economics. A growth rate is simply the percentage change in some quantity. It could be your income. It could be a business’s sales. It could be a nation’s GDP. The formula for computing a growth rate is straightforward:\n\\[\\text{Percentage change} = \\frac{\\text{Change in quantity}}{\\text{Quantity}}\\]\nSuppose your job pays $10 per hour. Your boss, however, is so impressed with your work that he gives you a $2 per hour raise. The percentage change (or growth rate) in your pay is $2/$10 = 0.20 or 20%.\nTo compute the growth rate for data over an extended period of time, for example, the average annual growth in GDP over a decade or more, the denominator is commonly defined a little differently. In the previous example, we defined the quantity as the initial quantity—or the quantity when we started. This is fine for a one-time calculation, but when we compute the growth over and over, it makes more sense to define the quantity as the average quantity over the period in question, which is defined as the quantity halfway between the initial quantity and the next quantity. This is harder to explain in words than to show with an example. Suppose a nation’s GDP was $1 trillion in 2005 and $1.03 trillion in 2006. The growth rate between 2005 and 2006 would be the change in GDP ($1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion) divided by the average GDP between 2005 and 2006 ($1.03 trillion + $1.00 trillion)/2. In other words:\n\\[= \\frac{$1.03 \\text{ trillion} – $1.00 \\text{ trillion}}{($1.03 \\text{ trillion} + $1.00 \\text{ trillion}) / 2}\\]\n\\[= \\frac{0.03}{1.015} = 0.0296 = 2.96\\% \\text{growth}\\]\nNote that if we used the first method, the calculation would be ($1.03 trillion – $1.00 trillion) / $1.00 trillion = 3% growth, which is approximately the same as the second, more complicated method. If you need a rough approximation, use the first method. If you need accuracy, use the second method.\nA few things to remember:\n\n\nA positive growth rate means the quantity is growing.\nA smaller growth rate means the quantity is growing more slowly.\nA larger growth rate means the quantity is growing more quickly.\nA negative growth rate means the quantity is decreasing.\n\n\nThe same change over times yields a smaller growth rate. If you got a $2 raise each year, in the first year the growth rate would be $2/$10 = 20%, as shown above. But in the second year, the growth rate would be $2/$12 = 0.167 or 16.7% growth. In the third year, the same $2 raise would correspond to a $2/$14 = 14.2%.\nThe moral of the story is this:\n\nTo keep the growth rate the same, the change must increase each period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nA growth rate is the percentage change of a variable from period 1 to period 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP today is 20 trillion US$. GDP next year is 21 trillion US$. What is the growth rate of GDP in this economy?",

    "text": "2.3 Displaying Data Graphically and Interpreting the Graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nLine Graphs\nPie Charts\nBar Graphs\n\n\n\nGraphs are also used to display data or evidence. Graphs are a method of presenting numerical patterns. They condense detailed numerical information into a visual form in which relationships and numerical patterns can be seen more easily. For example, which countries have larger or smaller populations? A careful reader could examine a long list of numbers representing the populations of many countries, but with over 200 nations in the world, searching through such a list would take concentration and time. Putting these same numbers on a graph can quickly reveal population patterns. Economists use graphs both for a compact and readable presentation of groups of numbers and for building an intuitive grasp of relationships and connections.\nThree types of graphs are used in this book: line graphs, pie graphs, and bar graphs. Each is discussed below. We also provide warnings about how graphs can be manipulated to alter viewers’ perceptions of the relationships in the data.\n\n2.3.1 Line Graphs\nThe graphs we have discussed so far are called line graphs, because they show a relationship between two variables: one measured on the horizontal axis and the other measured on the vertical axis.\nSometimes it is useful to show more than one set of data on the same axes. The data in Table 2.2 is displayed in Figure 2.3 which shows the relationship between two variables: length and median weight for American baby boys and girls during the first three years of life. (The median means that half of all babies weigh more than this and half weigh less.)\nThe line graph measures length in inches on the horizontal axis and weight in pounds on the vertical axis. For example, point A on Figure 2.3 shows that a boy who is 28 inches long will have a median weight of about 19 pounds. One line on the graph shows the length-weight relationship for boys and the other line shows the relationship for girls. This kind of graph is widely used by healthcare providers to check whether a child’s physical development is roughly on track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls. The line graph shows the relationship between height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years. Point A, for example, shows that a boy of 28 inches in height (measured on the horizontal axis) is typically 19 pounds in weight (measured on the vertical axis). These data apply only to children in the first three years of life.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows length (inches) along the x-axis and weight (pounds) along the y-axis. The following points reflect the length-weight ratio of American boys: (20, 8.0), (22, 10.5), (24, 13.5), (26, 16.4), (28, 19), (30, 21.8), (32, 24.3), (34, 27), (36, 9.3), (38, 32). The following points reflect the length-weight ratio of American girls: (20, 7.9), (22, 10.5), (24, 13.2), (26, 16), (28, 18.8), (30, 21.2), (32, 24), (34, 26.2), (36, 28.9), (38, 31.3).\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Length to Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls\n\n\n\n\n\nBoys from Birth to 36 Months\n\n\nLength (inches)\nWeight (pounds)\n\n\n\n\n20.0\n8.0\n\n\n22.0\n10.5\n\n\n24.0\n13.5\n\n\n26.0\n16.4\n\n\n28.0\n19.0\n\n\n30.0\n21.8\n\n\n32.0\n24.3\n\n\n34.0\n27.0\n\n\n36.0\n29.3\n\n\n38.0\n32.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGirls from Birth to 36 Months\n\n\nLength (inches)\nWeight (pounds)\n\n\n\n\n20.0\n7.9\n\n\n22.0\n10.5\n\n\n24.0\n13.2\n\n\n26.0\n16.0\n\n\n28.0\n18.8\n\n\n30.0\n21.2\n\n\n32.0\n24.0\n\n\n34.0\n26.2\n\n\n36.0\n28.9\n\n\n38.0\n31.3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot all relationships in economics are linear. Sometimes they are curves. Figure 2.4 presents another example of a line graph, representing the data from Table 2.3. In this case, the line graph shows how thin the air becomes when you climb a mountain. The horizontal axis of the figure shows altitude, measured in meters above sea level. The vertical axis measures the density of the air at each altitude.\nAir density is measured by the weight of the air in a cubic meter of space (that is, a box measuring one meter in height, width, and depth). As the graph shows, air pressure is heaviest at ground level and becomes lighter as you climb. Figure 2.4 shows that a cubic meter of air at an altitude of 500 meters weighs approximately one kilogram (about 2.2 pounds). However, as the altitude increases, air density decreases. A cubic meter of air at the top of Mount Everest, at about 8,828 meters, would weigh only 0.023 kilograms. The thin air at high altitudes explains why many mountain climbers need to use oxygen tanks as they reach the top of a mountain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Altitude Air Density Relationship. This line graph shows the relationship between altitude, measured in meters above sea level, and air density, measured in kilograms of air per cubic meter. As altitude rises, air density declines. The point at the top of Mount Everest has an altitude of approximately 8,828 meters above sea level (the horizontal axis) and air density of 0.023 kilograms per cubic meter (the vertical axis).\n\n\n\nThe graph shows altitude on the x-axis and air density on the y-axis. A downward sloping lines has the end points (0, 1.2) and (8.828, 0.023). End point (8,828, 0.023) represents the top of Mount Everest.\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Altitude to Air Density Relationship\n\n\n\n\n\nAltitude (meters)\nAir Density (kg/cubic meters)\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.200\n\n\n500\n1.093\n\n\n1,000\n0.831\n\n\n1,500\n0.678\n\n\n2,000\n0.569\n\n\n2,500\n0.484\n\n\n3,000\n0.415\n\n\n3,500\n0.357\n\n\n4,000\n0.307\n\n\n4,500\n0.231\n\n\n5,000\n0.182\n\n\n5,500\n0.142\n\n\n6,000\n0.100\n\n\n6,500\n0.085\n\n\n7,000\n0.066\n\n\n7,500\n0.051\n\n\n8,000\n0.041\n\n\n8,500\n0.025\n\n\n9,000\n0.022\n\n\n9,500\n0.019\n\n\n10,000\n0.014\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe length-weight relationship and the altitude-air density relationships in these two figures represent averages. If you were to collect actual data on air pressure at different altitudes, the same altitude in different geographic locations will have slightly different air density, depending on factors like how far you are from the equator, local weather conditions, and the humidity in the air. Similarly, in measuring the height and weight of children for the previous line graph, children of a particular height would have a range of different weights, some above average and some below. In the real world, this sort of variation in data is common. The task of a researcher is to organize that data in a way that helps to understand typical patterns. The study of statistics, especially when combined with computer statistics and spreadsheet programs, is a great help in organizing this kind of data, plotting line graphs, and looking for typical underlying relationships. For most economics and social science majors, a statistics course will be required at some point.\nOne common line graph is called a time series, in which the horizontal axis shows time and the vertical axis displays another variable. Thus, a time series graph shows how a variable changes over time. Figure 2.5 shows the unemployment rate in the United States since 1975, where unemployment is defined as the percentage of adults who want jobs and are looking for a job, but cannot find one.\nThe points for the unemployment rate in each year are plotted on the graph, and a line then connects the points, showing how the unemployment rate has moved up and down since 1975. The line graph makes it easy to see, for example, that the highest unemployment rate during this time period was slightly less than 10% in the early 1980s and 2010, while the unemployment rate declined from the early 1990s to the end of the 1990s, before rising and then falling back in the early 2000s, and then rising sharply during the recession from 2008–2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975–2014. This graph provides a quick visual summary of unemployment data. With a graph like this, it is easy to spot the times of high unemployment and of low unemployment.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows unemployment rates since 1970. The highest rates occurred around 1983 and 2010.\n\n\n2.3.2 Pie Graphs\nA pie graph (sometimes called a pie chart) is used to show how an overall total is divided into parts. A circle represents a group as a whole. The slices of this circular “pie” show the relative sizes of subgroups.\nFigure 2.6 shows how the U.S. population was divided among children, working age adults, and the elderly in 1970, 2000, and what is projected for 2030. The information is first conveyed with numbers in Table 2.4, and then in three pie charts.\nThe first column of Table shows the total U.S. population for each of the three years. Columns 2–4 categorize the total in terms of age groups—from birth to 18 years, from 19 to 64 years, and 65 years and above. In columns 2–4, the first number shows the actual number of people in each age category, while the number in parentheses shows the percentage of the total population comprised by that age group.\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: U.S. Age Distribution, 1970, 2000, and 2030 (projected)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nTotal Population\n19 and Under\n20–64 years\nOver 65\n\n\n\n\n1970\n205.0 million\n77.2 (37.6%)\n107.7 (52.5%)\n20.1 (9.8%)\n\n\n2000\n275.4 million\n78.4 (28.5%)\n162.2 (58.9%)\n34.8 (12.6%)\n\n\n2030\n351.1 million\n92.6 (26.4%)\n188.2 (53.6%)\n70.3 (20.0%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: Pie Graphs of the U.S. Age Distribution (numbers in millions). The three pie graphs illustrate the division of total population into three age groups for the three different years.\n\n\n\nThe image shows three pie graphs representing age distribution in the U.S. Image (a) shows that in 1970, people 19 and under made up 77.2 million or 37.6% of the population; people between ages 20 and 64 made up 107.7 million or 52.5% of the population; and people 65 or older made up 20.1 million or 9.8% of the population. Image (b) shows that in 2000, people 19 and under made up 78.4 million or 28.5% of the population; people between ages 20 and 64 made up 162.2 million or 58.9% of the population; and people 65 or older made up 34.8 million or 12.6% of the population. Image (c) projects that in 2030, people 19 and under will make up 92.6 million or 26.4% of the population; people between ages 20 and 64 made up 188.2 million or 53.6% of the population; and people 65 or older made up 70.3 million or 20% of the population.\nIn a pie graph, each slice of the pie represents a share of the total, or a percentage. For example, 50% would be half of the pie and 20% would be one-fifth of the pie. The three pie graphs in Figure 2.6 show that the share of the U.S. population 65 and over is growing.\nThe pie graphs allow you to get a feel for the relative size of the different age groups from 1970 to 2000 to 2030, without requiring you to slog through the specific numbers and percentages in the table.\nSome common examples of how pie graphs are used include dividing the population into groups by age, income level, ethnicity, religion, occupation; dividing different firms into categories by size, industry, number of employees; and dividing up government spending or taxes into its main categories.\n\n\n2.3.3 Bar Graphs\nA bar graph uses the height of different bars to compare quantities. Table 2.5 lists the 12 most populous countries in the world. Figure 2.7 provides this same data in a bar graph. The height of the bars corresponds to the population of each country. Although you may know that China and India are the most populous countries in the world, seeing how the bars on the graph tower over the other countries helps illustrate the magnitude of the difference between the sizes of national populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: Leading Countries of the World by Population, 2015 (in millions). The graph shows the 12 countries of the world with the largest populations. The height of the bars in the bar graph shows the size of the population for each country.\n\n\n\nThe bar graph shows population (millions) on the y-axis and lists various countries along the x-axis. The approximate population in 2015 for each of these countries is as follows: China = 1,369; India = 1,270; Unite States = 321, Indonesia = 255; Brazil = 204; Pakistan = 190; Bangladesh = 158; Russia = 146; Japan = 127; Mexico = 121; Philippines = 101.\nLeading 12 Countries of the World by Population\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Population Table\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nPopulation\n\n\n\n\nChina\n1,369\n\n\nIndia\n1,270\n\n\nU.S.\n321\n\n\nIndonesia\n255\n\n\nBrazil\n204\n\n\nPakistan\n190\n\n\nNigeria\n184\n\n\nBangladesh\n158\n\n\nRussia\n146\n\n\nJapan\n127\n\n\nMexico\n121\n\n\nPhilippines\n101\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBar graphs can be subdivided in a way that reveals information similar to that we can get from pie charts. Figure 2.8 offers three bar graphs based on the information from Figure 2.6 about the U.S. age distribution in 1970, 2000, and 2030.\nFigure 2.8 (a) shows three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. Figure 2.8 (b) shows just one bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. In Figure 2.8 (c), still based on the same data, the vertical axis measures percentages rather than the number of persons.\nIn this case, all three bar graphs are the same height, representing 100% of the population, with each bar divided according to the percentage of population in each age group. It is sometimes easier for a reader to run his or her eyes across several bar graphs, comparing the shaded areas, rather than trying to compare several pie graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: U.S. Population with Bar Graphs. Population data can be represented in different ways. (a) Shows three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. (b) Shows just one bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. (c) Sets the vertical axis as a measure of percentages rather than the number of persons. All three bar graphs are the same height and each bar is divided according to the percentage of population in each age group.\n\n\n\nThe image shows three bar graphs that represent the U.S. population. All three images reveal the same information presented in different ways. In 1970, people 19 and under made up 77.2 million or 37.6% of the population; people between ages 20 and 64 made up 107.7 million or 52.5% of the population; and people 65 or older made up 20.1 million or 9.8% of the population. In 2000, people 19 and under made up 78.4 million or 28.5% of the population; people between ages 20 and 64 made up 162.2 million or 58.9% of the population; and people 65 or older made up 34.8 million or 12.6% of the population. In 2030, the projection is that people 19 and under will make up 92.6 million or 26.4% of the population; people between ages 20 and 64 made up 188.2 million or 53.6% of the population; and people 65 or older made up 70.3 million or 20% of the population. Image (a) shows separate bar graphs for each age group in each time period (so 9 bars total). Image (b) shows the total population divided into age groups (so 3 bars total, with different color coding to identify the portions pertaining to different ages). Image (c) shows the total population divided into percentages to reveal the prediction that in 2030 (so 3 bars total, with different color coding to identify the portions pertaining to different ages).\nFigure 2.7 and Figure 2.8 show how the bars can represent countries or years, and how the vertical axis can represent a numerical or a percentage value. Bar graphs can also compare size, quantity, rates, distances, and other quantitative categories.\n\n\n2.3.4 How Graphs Can Be Misleading\nGraphs not only reveal patterns; they can also alter how patterns are perceived. To see some of the ways this can be done, consider the line graphs of Figure 2.9, Figure 2.10, and Figure 2.11. These graphs all illustrate the unemployment rate—but from different perspectives.\nAll three graphs present the exact same data but in different ways that may alter how the data is interpreted. Image (a) shows the unemployment rate wide and short. Image (b) shows the unemployment rate narrow and tall. Image (c) shows the unemployment rate, with wider range of numbers on the vertical axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate. Simply changing the width and height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate. Simply changing the width and height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate. Simply changing the width and height of the area in which data is displayed can alter the perception of the data.\n\n\n\nSuppose you wanted a graph which gives the impression that the rise in unemployment in 2009 was not all that large, or all that extraordinary by historical standards. You might choose to present your data as in Figure 2.9 (a). Figure 2.9 (a) includes much of the same data presented earlier in Figure 2.5, but stretches the horizontal axis out longer relative to the vertical axis. By spreading the graph wide and flat, the visual appearance is that the rise in unemployment is not so large, and is similar to some past rises in unemployment.\nNow imagine you wanted to emphasize how unemployment spiked substantially higher in 2009. In this case, using the same data, you can stretch the vertical axis out relative to the horizontal axis, as in Figure 2.9 (b), which makes all rises and falls in unemployment appear larger.\nA similar effect can be accomplished without changing the length of the axes, but by changing the scale on the vertical axis. In Figure 2.10 (c), the scale on the vertical axis runs from 0% to 30%, while in Figure 2.10 (d), the vertical axis runs from 3% to 10%. Compared to Figure 2.5, where the vertical scale runs from 0% to 12%, Figure 2.10 (c) makes the fluctuation in unemployment look smaller, while Figure 2.10 (d) makes it look larger.\nAnother way to alter the perception of the graph is to reduce the amount of variation by changing the number of points plotted on the graph. Figure 2.11 (e) shows the unemployment rate according to five-year averages. By averaging out some of the year-to-year changes, the line appears smoother and with fewer highs and lows. In reality, the unemployment rate is reported monthly, and Figure 2.11 (f) shows the monthly figures since 1960, which fluctuate more than the five-year average.\nFigure 2.11 (f) is also a vivid illustration of how graphs can compress lots of data. The graph includes monthly data since 1960, which over almost 50 years, works out to nearly 600 data points. Reading that list of 600 data points in numerical form would be hypnotic. You can, however, get a good intuitive sense of these 600 data points very quickly from the graph.\nA final trick in manipulating the perception of graphical information is that, by choosing the starting and ending points carefully, you can influence the perception of whether the variable is rising or falling. The original data show a general pattern with unemployment low in the 1960s, but spiking up in the mid-1970s, early 1980s, early 1990s, early 2000s, and late 2000s. Figure 2.11 (g), however, shows a graph that goes back only to 1975, which gives an impression that unemployment was more-or-less gradually falling over time until the 2009 recession pushed it back up to its “original” level—which is a plausible interpretation if one starts at the high point around 1975.\nThese kinds of tricks—or shall we just call them “presentation choices”— are not limited to line graphs. In a pie chart with many small slices and one large slice, someone must decided what categories should be used to produce these slices in the first place, thus making some slices appear bigger than others. If you are making a bar graph, you can make the vertical axis either taller or shorter, which will tend to make variations in the height of the bars appear more or less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\n\nBeing able to read graphs is an essential skill, both in economics and in life.\nA graph is just one perspective or point of view, shaped by choices such as those discussed in this section.\nDo not always believe the first quick impression from a graph.\nView with caution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nMath is a tool for understanding economics and economic relationships can be expressed mathematically using algebra or graphs.\nThe algebraic equation for a line is \\(y = b + m \\times x\\), where x is the variable on the horizontal axis and y is the variable on the vertical axis, the b term is the y-intercept and the m term is the slope.\nThe slope of a line is the same at any point on the line and it indicates the relationship (positive, negative, or zero) between two economic variables.\nEconomic models can be solved algebraically or graphically.\nGraphs allow you to illustrate data visually. They can illustrate patterns, comparisons, trends, and apportionment by condensing the numerical data and providing an intuitive sense of relationships in the data.\n\n\nA line graph shows the relationship between two variables: one is shown on the horizontal axis and one on the vertical axis.\nA pie graph shows how something is allotted, such as a sum of money or a group of people. The size of each slice of the pie is drawn to represent the corresponding percentage of the whole.\nA bar graph uses the height of bars to show a relationship, where each bar represents a certain entity, like a country or a group of people. The bars on a bar graph can also be divided into segments to show subgroups.\n\n\nAny graph is a single visual perspective on a subject. The impression it leaves will be based on many choices, such as what data or time frame is included, how data or groups are divided up, the relative size of vertical and horizontal axes, whether the scale used on a vertical starts at zero. Thus, any graph should be regarded somewhat skeptically, remembering that the underlying relationship can be open to different interpretations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName three kinds of graphs and briefly state when is most appropriate to use each type of graph.\nWhat is slope on a line graph?\nWhat do the slices of a pie chart represent?\nWhy is a bar chart the best way to illustrate comparisons?\nHow does the appearance of positive slope differ from negative slope and from zero slope?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Slope and the Algebra of Straight Lines. This line graph has x on the horizontal axis and y on the vertical axis. The y-intercept—that is, the point where the line intersects the y-axis—is 9. The slope of the line is 3; that is, there is a rise of 3 on the vertical axis for every increase of 1 on the horizontal axis. The slope is the same all along a straight line.\nFigure 2.2: Supply and Demand Graph. The equations for \\(Q_d\\) and \\(Q_s\\) are displayed graphically by the sloped lines.\nFigure 2.3: The Length-Weight Relationship for American Boys and Girls. The line graph shows the relationship between height and weight for boys and girls from birth to 3 years. Point A, for example, shows that a boy of 28 inches in height (measured on the horizontal axis) is typically 19 pounds in weight (measured on the vertical axis). These data apply only to children in the first three years of life.\nFigure 2.4: Altitude Air Density Relationship. This line graph shows the relationship between altitude, measured in meters above sea level, and air density, measured in kilograms of air per cubic meter. As altitude rises, air density declines. The point at the top of Mount Everest has an altitude of approximately 8,828 meters above sea level (the horizontal axis) and air density of 0.023 kilograms per cubic meter (the vertical axis).\nFigure 2.5: U.S. Unemployment Rate, 1975–2014. This graph provides a quick visual summary of unemployment data. With a graph like this, it is easy to spot the times of high unemployment and of low unemployment.\nFigure 2.6: Pie Graphs of the U.S. Age Distribution (numbers in millions). The three pie graphs illustrate the division of total population into three age groups for the three different years.\nFigure 2.7: Leading Countries of the World by Population, 2015 (in millions). The graph shows the 12 countries of the world with the largest populations. The height of the bars in the bar graph shows the size of the population for each country.\nFigure 2.8: U.S. Population with Bar Graphs. Population data can be represented in different ways. (a) Shows three bars for each year, representing the total number of persons in each age bracket for each year. (b) Shows just one bar for each year, but the different age groups are now shaded inside the bar. (c) Sets the vertical axis as a measure of percentages rather than the number of persons. All three bar graphs are the same height and each bar is divided according to the percentage of population in each age group.\nFigure 2.9: Presenting Unemployment Rates in Different Ways, All of Them Accurate.

    "text": "3.1 How Individuals Make Choices Based on Their Budget Constraint\nConsider the typical consumer’s budget problem. Consumers have a limited amount of income to spend on the things they need and want. Suppose Alphonso has $10 in spending money each week that he can allocate between bus tickets for getting to work and the burgers that he eats for lunch. Burgers cost $2 each, and bus tickets are 50 cents each. We can see Alphonso's budget problem in Figure 3.2 .\nThe vertical axis in the Figure 3.2 shows burger purchases and the horizontal axis shows bus ticket purchases. If Alphonso spends all his money on burgers, he can afford five per week. ($10 per week/$2 per burger = 5 burgers per week.) However, if he does this, he will not be able to afford any bus tickets. Point A in the Figure 3.2 shows the choice (zero bus tickets and five burgers). Alternatively, if Alphonso spends all his money on bus tickets, he can afford 20 per week. ($10 per week/$0.50 per bus ticket = 20 bus tickets per week.) Then, however, he will not be able to afford any burgers. Point F shows this alternative choice (20 bus tickets and zero burgers).\nIf we connect all the points between A and F, we get Alphonso's budget constraint. This indicates all the combination of burgers and bus tickets Alphonso can afford, given the price of the two goods and his budget amount.\nIf Alphonso is like most people, he will choose some combination that includes both bus tickets and burgers. That is, he will choose some combination on the budget constraint that is between points A and F. Every point on (or inside) the constraint shows a combination of burgers and bus tickets that Alphonso can afford. Any point outside the constraint is not affordable, because it would cost more money than Alphonso has in his budget.\nThe budget constraint clearly shows the tradeoff Alphonso faces in choosing between burgers and bus tickets. Suppose he is currently at point D, where he can afford 12 bus tickets and two burgers. What would it cost Alphonso for one more burger? It would be natural to answer $2, but that’s not the way economists think. Instead they ask, how many bus tickets would Alphonso have to give up to get one more burger, while staying within his budget? Since bus tickets cost 50 cents, Alphonso would have to give up four to afford one more burger. That is the true cost to Alphonso.",

The relative price of burgers and bus tickets determines the slope of the budget constraint. All along the budget set, giving up one burger means gaining four bus tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 The Concept of Opportunity Cost\nEconomists use the term opportunity cost to indicate what one must give up to obtain what he or she desires. The idea behind opportunity cost is that the cost of one item is the lost opportunity to do or consume something else. In short, opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. For Alphonso, the opportunity cost of a burger is the four bus tickets he would have to give up. He would decide whether or not to choose the burger depending on whether the value of the burger exceeds the value of the forgone alternative—in this case, bus tickets. Since people must choose, they inevitably face tradeoffs in which they have to give up things they desire to obtain other things they desire more.\nA fundamental principle of economics is that every choice has an opportunity cost. If you sleep through your economics class, the opportunity cost is the learning you miss from not attending class. If you spend your income on video games, you cannot spend it on movies. If you choose to marry one person, you give up the opportunity to marry anyone else. In short, opportunity cost is all around us and part of human existence.\nThe following Work It Out feature shows a step-by-step analysis of a budget constraint calculation. Read through it to understand another important concept—slope—that we further explain in the appendix The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUNDERSTANDING BUDGET CONSTRAINTS\nBudget constraints are easy to understand if you apply a little math. The appendix The Use of Mathematics in Principles of Economics explains all the math you are likely to need in this book. Therefore, if math is not your strength, you might want to take a look at the appendix.\n\nStep 1\n\nThe equation for any budget constraint is:\n\n\n\\[\\text{Budget}=P_1 \\times Q_1 + P_2 \\times Q_2,\\]\nwhere P and Q are the price and quantity of items purchased (which we assume here to be two items) and Budget is the amount of income one has to spend.\n\nStep 2\n\nApply the budget constraint equation to the scenario. In Alphonso’s case, this works out to be:\n\n\n\\[\\text{Budget}=P_1 \\times Q_1 + P_2 \\times Q_2,\\]\n\\[\\$10=\\$2 \\text{ per burger} \\times \\text{quantity of burgers} + \\$0.50 \\text{ per bus ticket} \\times \\text{quantity of bus tickets}\\]\n\\[\\$10=\\$2 \\times Q_{burgers} + \\$0.50 \\times Q_{bus-tickets}\\]\n\nStep 3\n\nUsing a little algebra, we can turn this into the familiar equation of a line:\n\n\n\\[y = b + m \\times x\\]\nRemember that \\(b\\) is the intercept with the vertical axis and \\(m\\) is the slope of this line. We have to rearrange our budget constraint somewhat to translate it into this particular form.\nFor Alphonso, this is:\n\\[\\$10 = \\$2 × Q_{burgers} + \\$0.50 \\times Q_{bus-tickets}\\]\n\nStep 4\n\nSimplify the equation. Begin by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n\n\\[20 =  4 \\times Q_{burgers} + 1 × Q_{bus-tickets}\\]\n\nStep 5\n\nSubtract one bus ticket from both sides:\n\n\n\\[20 – Q_{bus-tickets} = 4 \\times Q_{burgers}\\]\nDivide each side by 4 to yield the answer:\n\\[5 – 0.25 \\times Q_{bus-tickets} = Q_{burgers}\\]\nor\n\\[Q_{burgers} = 5 – 0.25 \\times Q_{bus-tickets}\\]\n\nStep 6\n\nNotice that this equation fits the budget constraint in Figure 3.2.\n\n\nThe vertical intercept is 5 and the slope is –0.25, just as the equation says. If you plug 20 bus tickets into the equation, you get 0 burgers. If you plug other numbers of bus tickets into the equation, you get the results (see Table 3.1 ), which are the points on Alphonso’s budget constraint.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Burgers and Bus Tickets\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint\nQuantity of Burgers (at $2)\nQuantity of Bus Tickets (at 50 cents)\n\n\n\n\nA\n5\n0\n\n\nB\n4\n4\n\n\nC\n3\n8\n\n\nD\n2\n12\n\n\nE\n1\n16\n\n\nF\n0\n20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7\n\nNotice that the slope of a budget constraint always shows the opportunity cost of the good which is on the horizontal axis. For Alphonso, the slope is −0.25, indicating that for every bus ticket he buys, he must give up 1/4 burger. To phrase it differently, for every four tickets he buys, Alphonso must give up 1 burger.\nThere are two important observations here. First, the algebraic sign of the slope is negative, which means that the only way to get more of one good is to give up some of the other. Second, we define the slope as the price of bus tickets (whatever is on the horizontal axis in the graph) divided by the price of burgers (whatever is on the vertical axis), in this case $0.50/$2 = 0.25. If you want to determine the opportunity cost quickly, just divide the two prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Identifying Opportunity Cost\nIn many cases, it is reasonable to refer to the opportunity cost as the price. If your cousin buys a new bicycle for $300, then $300 measures the amount of “other consumption” that he has forsaken. For practical purposes, there may be no special need to identify the specific alternative product or products that he could have bought with that $300, but sometimes the price as measured in dollars may not accurately capture the true opportunity cost. This problem can loom especially large when costs of time are involved.\nFor example, consider a boss who decides that all employees will attend a two-day retreat to “build team spirit.” The out-of-pocket monetary cost of the event may involve hiring an outside consulting firm to run the retreat, as well as room and board for all participants. However, an opportunity cost exists as well: during the two days of the retreat, none of the employees are doing any other work.\nAttending college is another case where the opportunity cost exceeds the monetary cost. The out-of-pocket costs of attending college include tuition, books, room and board, and other expenses. However, in addition, during the hours that you are attending class and studying, it is impossible to work at a paying job. Thus, college imposes both an out-of-pocket cost and an opportunity cost of lost earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE OPPORTUNITY COST ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED AIRPORT SECURITY MEASURES?\nAfter the terrorist plane hijackings on September 11, 2001, many steps were proposed to improve air travel safety. For example, the federal government could provide armed “sky marshals” who would travel inconspicuously with the rest of the passengers. The cost of having a sky marshal on every flight would be roughly $3 billion per year. Retrofitting all U.S. planes with reinforced cockpit doors to make it harder for terrorists to take over the plane would have a price tag of $450 million. Buying more sophisticated security equipment for airports, like three-dimensional baggage scanners and cameras linked to face recognition software, could cost another $2 billion.\nHowever, the single biggest cost of greater airline security does not involve spending money. It is the opportunity cost of additional waiting time at the airport. According to the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), there were 895.5 million systemwide (domestic and international) scheduled service passengers in 2015. Since the 9/11 hijackings, security screening has become more intensive, and consequently, the procedure takes longer than in the past. Say that, on average, each air passenger spends an extra 30 minutes in the airport per trip. Economists commonly place a value on time to convert an opportunity cost in time into a monetary figure. Because many air travelers are relatively high-paid business people, conservative estimates set the average price of time for air travelers at $20 per hour. By these back-of-the-envelope calculations, the opportunity cost of delays in airports could be as much as 800 million × 0.5 hours × $20/hour, or $8 billion per year. Clearly, the opportunity costs of waiting time can be just as important as costs that involve direct spending.\n\n\nIn some cases, realizing the opportunity cost can alter behavior. Imagine, for example, that you spend $8 on lunch every day at work. You may know perfectly well that bringing a lunch from home would cost only $3 a day, so the opportunity cost of buying lunch at the restaurant is $5 each day (that is, the $8 buying lunch costs minus the $3 your lunch from home would cost). Five dollars each day does not seem to be that much. However, if you project what that adds up to in a year—250 days a year × $5 per day equals $1,250, the cost, perhaps, of a decent vacation. If you describe the opportunity cost as “a nice vacation” instead of “$5 a day,” you might make different choices.\n\n\n3.1.3 Marginal Decision-Making and Diminishing Marginal Utility\nThe budget constraint framework helps to emphasize that most choices in the real world are not about getting all of one thing or all of another; that is, they are not about choosing either the point at one end of the budget constraint or else the point all the way at the other end. Instead, most choices involve marginal analysis, which means examining the benefits and costs of choosing a little more or a little less of a good. People naturally compare costs and benefits, but often we look at total costs and total benefits, when the optimal choice necessitates comparing how costs and benefits change from one option to another. You might think of marginal analysis as “change analysis.” Marginal analysis is used throughout economics.\nWe now turn to the notion of utility. People desire goods and services for the satisfaction or utility those goods and services provide. Utility, as we will see in the chapter on Consumer Choices, is subjective but that does not make it less real. Economists typically assume that the more of some good one consumes (for example, slices of pizza), the more utility one obtains. At the same time, the utility a person receives from consuming the first unit of a good is typically more than the utility received from consuming the fifth or the tenth unit of that same good. When Alphonso chooses between burgers and bus tickets, for example, the first few bus rides that he chooses might provide him with a great deal of utility—perhaps they help him get to a job interview or a doctor’s appointment. However, later bus rides might provide much less utility—they may only serve to kill time on a rainy day. Similarly, the first burger that Alphonso chooses to buy may be on a day when he missed breakfast and is ravenously hungry.\nHowever, if Alphonso has a burger every single day, the last few burgers may taste pretty boring. The general pattern that consumption of the first few units of any good tends to bring a higher level of utility to a person than consumption of later units is a common pattern. Economists refer to this pattern as the law of diminishing marginal utility, which means that as a person receives more of a good, the additional (or marginal) utility from each additional unit of the good declines. In other words, the first slice of pizza brings more satisfaction than the sixth.\nThe law of diminishing marginal utility explains why people and societies rarely make all-or-nothing choices. You would not say, “My favorite food is ice cream, so I will eat nothing but ice cream from now on.” Instead, even if you get a very high level of utility from your favorite food, if you ate it exclusively, the additional or marginal utility from those last few servings would not be very high.\nSimilarly, most workers do not say: “I enjoy leisure, so I’ll never work.” Instead, workers recognize that even though some leisure is very nice, a combination of all leisure and no income is not so attractive. The budget constraint framework suggests that when people make choices in a world of scarcity, they will use marginal analysis and think about whether they would prefer a little more or a little less.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Marginal Principle\nA rational consumer would only purchase additional units of some product as long as the marginal utility exceeds the opportunity cost.\n\n\nSuppose Alphonso moves down his budget constraint from Point A to Point B to Point C and further. As he consumes more bus tickets, the marginal utility of bus tickets will diminish, while the opportunity cost, that is, the marginal utility of foregone burgers, will increase. Eventually, the opportunity cost will exceed the marginal utility of an additional bus ticket. If Alphonso is rational, he won’t purchase more bus tickets once the marginal utility just equals the opportunity cost. While we can’t (yet) say exactly how many bus tickets Alphonso will buy, that number is unlikely to be the most he can afford, 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Marginal Principle more Formally\nYou \"do an activity\" until the marginal cost (MC) equals the marginal benefit (MB). You will often see this as:\n\\[MC = MB\\]\n\n\nEconomists use marginal analysis when figuring out what is optimal to do. They rarely use absolute cost of an activity. It's usually the marginal cost that is the important quantity to watch.\nIf the marginal cost of an activity exceeds the marginal benefit then you would reduce this activity until MC=MB. Or if that is not possible and you can only do the activity or not (a binary choice) then you would not do the activity at all!\n\n\n3.1.4 Sunk Costs\nIn the budget constraint framework, all decisions involve what will happen next: that is, what quantities of goods will you consume, how many hours will you work, or how much will you save. These decisions do not look back to past choices. Thus, the budget constraint framework assumes that sunk costs, which are costs that were incurred in the past and cannot be recovered, should not affect the current decision.\nConsider the case of Selena, who pays $8 to see a movie, but after watching the film for 30 minutes, she knows that it is truly terrible. Should she stay and watch the rest of the movie because she paid for the ticket, or should she leave? The money she spent is a sunk cost, and unless the theater manager is sympathetic, Selena will not get a refund. However, staying in the movie still means paying an opportunity cost in time. Her choice is whether to spend the next 90 minutes suffering through a cinematic disaster or to do something—anything—else. The lesson of sunk costs is to forget about the money and time that is irretrievably gone and instead to focus on the marginal costs and benefits of current and future options.\nFor people and firms alike, dealing with sunk costs can be frustrating. It often means admitting an earlier error in judgment. Many firms, for example, find it hard to give up on a new product that is doing poorly because they spent so much money in creating and launching the product. However, the lesson of sunk costs is to ignore them and make decisions based on what will happen in the future.\n\n\n3.1.5 From a Model with Two Goods to One of Many Goods\nThe budget constraint diagram containing just two goods, like most models used in this book, is not realistic. After all, in a modern economy people choose from thousands of goods. However, thinking about a model with many goods is a straightforward extension of what we discussed here. Instead of drawing just one budget constraint, showing the tradeoff between two goods, you can draw multiple budget constraints, showing the possible tradeoffs between many different pairs of goods.\nIn more advanced classes in economics, you would use mathematical equations that include many possible goods and services that can be purchased, together with their quantities and prices, and show how the total spending on all goods and services is limited to the overall budget available. The graph with two goods that we presented here clearly illustrates that every choice has an opportunity cost, which is the point that does carry over to the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nEconomists see the real world as one of scarcity: that is, a world in which people’s desires exceed what is possible. As a result, economic behavior involves tradeoffs in which individuals, firms, and society must forgo something that they desire to obtain things that they desire more. Individuals face the tradeoff of what quantities of goods and services to consume. The budget constraint, which is the frontier of the opportunity set, illustrates the range of available choices. The relative price of the choices determines the slope of the budget constraint. Choices beyond the budget constraint are not affordable.\nOpportunity cost measures cost by what we forgo in exchange. Sometimes we can measure opportunity cost in money, but it is often useful to consider time as well, or to measure it in terms of the actual resources that we must forfeit.\nMost economic decisions and tradeoffs are not all-or-nothing. Instead, they involve marginal analysis, which means they are about decisions on the margin, involving a little more or a little less. The law of diminishing marginal utility points out that as a person receives more of something—whether it is a specific good or another resource—the additional marginal gains tend to become smaller. Because sunk costs occurred in the past and cannot be recovered, they should be disregarded in making current decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose Alphonso’s town raised the price of bus tickets to $1 per trip (while the price of burgers stayed at $2 and his budget remained $10 per week.) Draw Alphonso’s new budget constraint. What happens to the opportunity cost of bus tickets?\nExplain why scarcity leads to tradeoffs.\nExplain why individuals make choices that are directly on the budget constraint, rather than inside the budget constraint or outside it.\nSuppose Alphonso’s town raises the price of bus tickets from $0.50 to $1 and the price of burgers rises from $2 to $4. Why is the opportunity cost of bus tickets unchanged? Suppose Alphonso’s weekly spending money increases from $10 to $20. How is his budget constraint affected from all three changes? Explain.",

This section of the chapter will explain the constraints society faces, using a model called the production possibilities frontier (PPF). There are more similarities than differences between individual choice and social choice. As you read this section, focus on the similarities.\nBecause society has limited resources (e.g., labor, land, capital, raw materials) at any point in time, there is a limit to the quantities of goods and services it can produce. Suppose a society desires two products, healthcare and education. The production possibilities frontier in Figure illustrates this situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: This production possibilities frontier shows a tradeoff between devoting social resources to healthcare and devoting them to education. At A all resources go to healthcare and at B, most go to healthcare. At D most resources go to education, and at F, all go to education.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3 shows healthcare on the vertical axis and education on the horizontal axis. If the society were to allocate all of its resources to healthcare, it could produce at point A. However, it would not have any resources to produce education. If it were to allocate all of its resources to education, it could produce at point F. Alternatively, the society could choose to produce any combination of healthcare and education on the production possibilities frontier. In effect, the production possibilities frontier plays the same role for society as the budget constraint plays for Alphonso. Society can choose any combination of the two goods on or inside the PPF. However, it does not have enough resources to produce outside the PPF.\nMost importantly, the production possibilities frontier clearly shows the tradeoff between healthcare and education. Suppose society has chosen to operate at point B, and it is considering producing more education. Because the PPF is downward sloping from left to right, the only way society can obtain more education is by giving up some healthcare. That is the tradeoff society faces. Suppose it considers moving from point B to point C. What would the opportunity cost be for the additional education? The opportunity cost would be the healthcare society has to forgo. Just as with Alphonso’s budget constraint, the slope of the production possibilities frontier shows the opportunity cost. By now you might be saying, “Hey, this PPF is sounding like the budget constraint.” If so, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BUDGET CONSTRAINT AND A PPF?\nThere are two major differences between a budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier. The first is the fact that the budget constraint is a straight line. This is because its slope is given by the relative prices of the two goods, which from the point of view of an individual consumer, are fixed, so the slope doesn't change. In contrast, the PPF has a curved shape because of the law of the diminishing returns. Thus, the slope is different at various points on the PPF. The second major difference is the absence of specific numbers on the axes of the PPF. There are no specific numbers because we do not know the exact amount of resources this imaginary economy has, nor do we know how many resources it takes to produce healthcare and how many resources it takes to produce education. If this were a real world example, that data would be available.\nWhether or not we have specific numbers, conceptually we can measure the opportunity cost of additional education as society moves from point B to point C on the PPF. We measure the additional education by the horizontal distance between B and C. The foregone healthcare is given by the vertical distance between B and C. The slope of the PPF between B and C is (approximately) the vertical distance (the “rise”) over the horizontal distance (the “run”). This is the opportunity cost of the additional education.\n\n\n\n3.2.1 The Shape of the PPF and the Law of Diminishing Returns\nThe budget constraints that we presented earlier in this chapter, showing individual choices about what quantities of goods to consume, were all straight lines. The reason for these straight lines was that the relative prices of the two goods in the consumption budget constraint determined the slope of the budget constraint. However, we drew the production possibilities frontier for healthcare and education as a curved line. Why does the PPF have a different shape?\nTo understand why the PPF is curved, start by considering point A at the top left-hand side of the PPF. At point A, all available resources are devoted to healthcare and none are left for education. This situation would be extreme and even ridiculous. For example, children are seeing a doctor every day, whether they are sick or not, but not attending school. People are having cosmetic surgery on every part of their bodies, but no high school or college education exists. Now imagine that some of these resources are diverted from healthcare to education, so that the economy is at point B instead of point A. Diverting some resources away from A to B causes relatively little reduction in health because the last few marginal dollars going into healthcare services are not producing much additional gain in health. However, putting those marginal dollars into education, which is completely without resources at point A, can produce relatively large gains. For this reason, the shape of the PPF from A to B is relatively flat, representing a relatively small drop-off in health and a relatively large gain in education.\nNow consider the other end, at the lower right, of the production possibilities frontier. Imagine that society starts at choice D, which is devoting nearly all resources to education and very few to healthcare, and moves to point F, which is devoting all spending to education and none to healthcare. For the sake of concreteness, you can imagine that in the movement from D to F, the last few doctors must become high school science teachers, the last few nurses must become school librarians rather than dispensers of vaccinations, and the last few emergency rooms are turned into kindergartens. The gains to education from adding these last few resources to education are very small. However, the opportunity cost lost to health will be fairly large, and thus the slope of the PPF between D and F is steep, showing a large drop in health for only a small gain in education.\nThe lesson is not that society is likely to make an extreme choice like devoting no resources to education at point A or no resources to health at point F. Instead, the lesson is that the gains from committing additional marginal resources to education depend on how much is already being spent. If on the one hand, very few resources are currently committed to education, then an increase in resources used can bring relatively large gains. On the other hand, if a large number of resources are already committed to education, then committing additional resources will bring relatively smaller gains.\nThis pattern is common enough that economists have given it a name: the law of diminishing returns, which holds that as additional increments of resources are added to a certain purpose, the marginal benefit from those additional increments will decline. (The law of diminishing marginal utility that we introduced in the last section is a more specific case of the law of diminishing returns.) When government spends a certain amount more on reducing crime, for example, the original gains in reducing crime could be relatively large. However, additional increases typically cause relatively smaller reductions in crime, and paying for enough police and security to reduce crime to nothing at all would be tremendously expensive.\n\nVideo - Production Possibility Frontier\n\n    \n\n\nThe curvature of the production possibilities frontier shows that as we add more resources to education, moving from left to right along the horizontal axis, the original gains are fairly large, but gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively flat. By contrast, as we add more resources to healthcare, moving from bottom to top on the vertical axis, the original gains are fairly large, but again gradually diminish. Thus, the slope of the PPF is relatively steep. In this way, the law of diminishing returns produces the outward-bending shape of the production possibilities frontier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLaw of Diminishing Returns\nIn production theory the law of diminishing returns states that if you double one of your input factors (say labor) while holding other factors of production constant (say machines), then output will increase but NOT double.\nAs you add workers, they become less productive which means that output per additional worker decreases. This happens because the number of machines is held constant. So as you add workers overall output will increase, BUT at a diminishing rate.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Productive Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency\nThe study of economics does not presume to tell a society what choice it should make along its production possibilities frontier. In a market-oriented economy with a democratic government, the choice will involve a mixture of decisions by individuals, firms, and government. However, economics can point out that some choices are unambiguously better than others. This observation is based on the concept of efficiency. In everyday usage, efficiency refers to lack of waste. An inefficient machine operates at high cost, while an efficient machine operates at lower cost, because it is not wasting energy or materials. An inefficient organization operates with long delays and high costs, while an efficient organization meets schedules, is focused, and performs within budget.\nThe production possibilities frontier can illustrate two kinds of efficiency: productive efficiency and allocative efficiency. fig-choice_004 illustrates these ideas using a production possibilities frontier between healthcare and education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: Productive efficiency means it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. Thus, all choices along a given PPF like B, C, and D display productive efficiency, but R does not. Allocative efficiency means that the particular mix of goods being produced—that is, the specific choice along the production possibilities frontier—represents the allocation that society most desires.\n\n\n\n\nProductive efficiency ,\n\nmeans that, given the available inputs and technology, it is impossible to produce more of one good without decreasing the quantity that is produced of another good. All choices on the PPF in Figure Figure 3.4, including A, B, C, D, and F, display productive efficiency. As a firm moves from any one of these choices to any other, either healthcare increases and education decreases or vice versa. However, any choice inside the production possibilities frontier is productively inefficient and wasteful because it is possible to produce more of one good, the other good, or some combination of both goods.\n\n\nFor example, point R is productively inefficient because it is possible at choice C to have more of both goods: education on the horizontal axis is higher at point C than point R (E2 is greater than E1), and healthcare on the vertical axis is also higher at point C than point R (H2 is great than H1).\nWe can show the particular mix of goods and services produced—that is, the specific combination of selected healthcare and education along the production possibilities frontier—as a ray (line) from the origin to a specific point on the PPF. Output mixes that had more healthcare (and less education) would have a steeper ray, while those with more education (and less healthcare) would have a flatter ray.\n\nAllocative efficiency\n\nmeans that the particular combination of goods and services on the production possibility curve that a society produces represents the combination that society most desires. How to determine what a society desires can be a controversial question, and is usually a discussion in political science, sociology, and philosophy classes as well as in economics. At its most basic, allocative efficiency means producers supply the quantity of each product that consumers demand. Only one of the productively efficient choices will be the allocatively efficient choice for society as a whole.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Why Society Must Choose\nIn Welcome to Economics! we learned that every society faces the problem of scarcity, where limited resources conflict with unlimited needs and wants. The production possibilities curve illustrates the choices involved in this dilemma.\nEvery economy faces two situations in which it may be able to expand consumption of all goods. In the first case, a society may discover that it has been using its resources inefficiently, in which case by improving efficiency and producing on the production possibilities frontier, it can have more of all goods (or at least more of some and less of none). In the second case, as resources grow over a period of years (e.g., more labor and more capital), the economy grows. As it does, the production possibilities frontier for a society will tend to shift outward and society will be able to afford more of all goods.\nHowever, improvements in productive efficiency take time to discover and implement, and economic growth happens only gradually. Thus, a society must choose between tradeoffs in the present. For government, this process often involves trying to identify where additional spending could do the most good and where reductions in spending would do the least harm. At the individual and firm level, the market economy coordinates a process in which firms seek to produce goods and services in the quantity, quality, and price that people want. However, for both the government and the market economy in the short term, increases in production of one good typically mean offsetting decreases somewhere else in the economy.\n\n\n3.2.4 The PPF and Comparative Advantage\nWhile every society must choose how much of each good or service it should produce, it does not need to produce every single good it consumes. Often how much of a good a country decides to produce depends on how expensive it is to produce it versus buying it from a different country. As we saw earlier, the curvature of a country’s PPF gives us information about the tradeoff between devoting resources to producing one good versus another. In particular, its slope gives the opportunity cost of producing one more unit of the good in the x-axis in terms of the other good (in the y-axis). Countries tend to have different opportunity costs of producing a specific good, either because of different climates, geography, technology, or skills.\nSuppose two countries, the US and Brazil, need to decide how much they will produce of two crops: sugar cane and wheat. Due to its climatic conditions, Brazil can produce quite a bit of sugar cane per acre but not much wheat. Conversely, the U.S. can produce large amounts of wheat per acre, but not much sugar cane. Clearly, Brazil has a lower opportunity cost of producing sugar cane (in terms of wheat) than the U.S. The reverse is also true: the U.S. has a lower opportunity cost of producing wheat than Brazil. We illustrate this by the PPFs of the two countries in Figure 3.5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: The U.S. PPF is flatter than the Brazil PPF implying that the opportunity cost of wheat in terms of sugar cane is lower in the U.S. than in Brazil. Conversely, the opportunity cost of sugar cane is lower in Brazil. The U.S. has comparative advantage in wheat and Brazil has comparative advantage in sugar cane.\n\n\n\nWhen a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost than another country, we say that this country has a comparative advantage in that good. In our example, Brazil has a comparative advantage in sugar cane and the U.S. has a comparative advantage in wheat. One can easily see this with a simple observation of the extreme production points in the PPFs of the two countries. If Brazil devoted all of its resources to producing wheat, it would be producing at point A. If however it had devoted all of its resources to producing sugar cane instead, it would be producing a much larger amount, at point B. By moving from point A to point B Brazil would give up a relatively small quantity in wheat production to obtain a large production in sugar cane. The opposite is true for the U.S. If the U.S. moved from point A to B and produced only sugar cane, this would result in a large opportunity cost in terms of foregone wheat production.\nThe slope of the PPF gives the opportunity cost of producing an additional unit of wheat. While the slope is not constant throughout the PPFs, it is quite apparent that the PPF in Brazil is much steeper than in the U.S., and therefore the opportunity cost of wheat generally higher in Brazil. In the chapter on International Trade you will learn that countries’ differences in comparative advantage determine which goods they will choose to produce and trade. When countries engage in trade, they specialize in the production of the goods in which they have comparative advantage, and trade part of that production for goods in which they do not have comparative advantage. With trade, manufacturers produce goods where the opportunity cost is lowest, so total production increases, benefiting both trading parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nA production possibilities frontier defines the set of choices society faces for the combinations of goods and services it can produce given the resources available. The shape of the PPF is typically curved outward, rather than straight. Choices outside the PPF are unattainable and choices inside the PPF are wasteful. Over time, a growing economy will tend to shift the PPF outwards.\nThe law of diminishing returns holds that as increments of additional resources are devoted to producing something, the marginal increase in output will become increasingly smaller. All choices along a production possibilities frontier display productive efficiency; that is, it is impossible to use society’s resources to produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. The specific choice along a production possibilities frontier that reflects the mix of goods society prefers is the choice with allocative efficiency. The curvature of the PPF is likely to differ by country, which results in different countries having comparative advantage in different goods. Total production can increase if countries specialize in the goods in which they have comparative advantage and trade some of their production for the remaining goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCould a nation be producing in a way that is allocatively efficient, but productively inefficient?\nWhat are the similarities between a consumer’s budget constraint and society’s production possibilities frontier, not just graphically but analytically?\nWhat is comparative advantage?\nWhat does a production possibilities frontier illustrate?\nWhy is a production possibilities frontier typically drawn as a curve, rather than a straight line?\nExplain why societies cannot make a choice above their production possibilities frontier and should not make a choice below it.\nWhat are diminishing marginal returns?\nWhat is productive efficiency? Allocative efficiency?\nDuring the Second World War, Germany’s factories were decimated. It also suffered many human casualties, both soldiers and civilians. How did the war affect Germany’s production possibilities curve?\nIt is clear that productive inefficiency is a waste since resources are used in a way that produces less goods and services than a nation is capable of. Why is allocative inefficiency also wasteful?",

    "text": "3.3 Confronting Objections to the Economic Approach\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze arguments against economic approaches to decision-making\nInterpret a tradeoff diagram\nContrast normative statements and positive statements\n\n\n\nIt is one thing to understand the economic approach to decision-making and another thing to feel comfortable applying it. The sources of discomfort typically fall into two categories: that people do not act in the way that fits the economic way of thinking, and that even if people did act that way, they should try not to. Let’s consider these arguments in turn.\n\n3.3.1 First Objection: People, Firms, and Society Do Not Act Like This\nThe economic approach to decision-making seems to require more information than most individuals possess and more careful decision-making than most individuals actually display. After all, do you or any of your friends draw a budget constraint and mutter to yourself about maximizing utility before you head to the shopping mall? Do members of the U.S. Congress contemplate production possibilities frontiers before they vote on the annual budget? The messy ways in which people and societies operate somehow doesn’t look much like neat budget constraints or smoothly curving production possibilities frontiers.\nHowever, the economics approach can be a useful way to analyze and understand the tradeoffs of economic decisions. To appreciate this point, imagine for a moment that you are playing basketball, dribbling to the right, and throwing a bounce-pass to the left to a teammate who is running toward the basket. A physicist or engineer could work out the correct speed and trajectory for the pass, given the different movements involved and the weight and bounciness of the ball. However, when you are playing basketball, you do not perform any of these calculations. You just pass the ball, and if you are a good player, you will do so with high accuracy.\nSomeone might argue: “The scientist’s formula of the bounce-pass requires a far greater knowledge of physics and far more specific information about speeds of movement and weights than the basketball player actually has, so it must be an unrealistic description of how basketball passes actually occur.” This reaction would be wrongheaded. The fact that a good player can throw the ball accurately because of practice and skill, without making a physics calculation, does not mean that the physics calculation is wrong.\nSimilarly, from an economic point of view, someone who shops for groceries every week has a great deal of practice with how to purchase the combination of goods that will provide that person with utility, even if the shopper does not phrase decisions in terms of a budget constraint. Government institutions may work imperfectly and slowly, but in general, a democratic form of government feels pressure from voters and social institutions to make the choices that are most widely preferred by people in that society. Thus, when thinking about the economic actions of groups of people, firms, and society, it is reasonable, as a first approximation, to analyze them with the tools of economic analysis. For more on this, read about behavioral economics in the chapter on Consumer Choices.\n\n\n3.3.2 Second Objection: People, Firms, and Society Should Not Act This Way\nThe economics approach portrays people as self-interested. For some critics of this approach, even if self-interest is an accurate description of how people behave, these behaviors are not moral. Instead, the critics argue that people should be taught to care more deeply about others. Economists offer several answers to these concerns.\nFirst, economics is not a form of moral instruction. Rather, it seeks to describe economic behavior as it actually exists. Philosophers draw a distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements, which describe how the world should be. Positive statements are factual. They may be true or false, but we can test them, at least in principle. Normative statements are subjective questions of opinion. We cannot test them since we cannot prove opinions to be true or false. They just are opinions based on one's values. For example, an economist could analyze a proposed subway system in a certain city. If the expected benefits exceed the costs, he concludes that the project is worthy—an example of positive analysis. Another economist argues for extended unemployment compensation during the Great Depression because a rich country like the United States should take care of its less fortunate citizens—an example of normative analysis.\nEven if the line between positive and normative statements is not always crystal clear, economic analysis does try to remain rooted in the study of the actual people who inhabit the actual economy. Fortunately however, the assumption that individuals are purely self-interested is a simplification about human nature. In fact, we need to look no further than to Adam Smith, the very father of modern economics to find evidence of this. The opening sentence of his book, The Theory of Moral Sentiments, puts it very clearly: “How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.” Clearly, individuals are both self-interested and altruistic.\nSecond, we can label self-interested behavior and profit-seeking with other names, such as personal choice and freedom. The ability to make personal choices about buying, working, and saving is an important personal freedom. Some people may choose high-pressure, high-paying jobs so that they can earn and spend considerable amounts of money on themselves. Others may allocate large portions of their earnings to charity or spend it on their friends and family. Others may devote themselves to a career that can require much time, energy, and expertise but does not offer high financial rewards, like being an elementary school teacher or a social worker. Still others may choose a job that does consume much of their time or provide a high level of income, but still leaves time for family, friends, and contemplation. Some people may prefer to work for a large company; others might want to start their own business. People’s freedom to make their own economic choices has a moral value worth respecting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIS A DIAGRAM BY ANY OTHER NAME THE SAME?\nWhen you study economics, you may feel buried under an avalanche of diagrams. Your goal should be to recognize the common underlying logic and pattern of the diagrams, not to memorize each one.\nThis chapter uses only one basic diagram, although we present it with different sets of labels. The consumption budget constraint and the production possibilities frontier for society, as a whole, are the same basic diagram. Figure 3.6 shows an individual budget constraint and a production possibilities frontier for two goods, Good 1 and Good 2. The tradeoff diagram always illustrates three basic themes: scarcity, tradeoffs, and economic efficiency.\nThe first theme is scarcity. It is not feasible to have unlimited amounts of both goods. Even if the budget constraint or a PPF shifts, scarcity remains—just at a different level. The second theme is tradeoffs. As depicted in the budget constraint or the production possibilities frontier, it is necessary to forgo some of one good to gain more of the other good. The details of this tradeoff vary. In a budget constraint we determine, the tradeoff is determined by the relative prices of the goods: that is, the relative price of two goods in the consumption choice budget constraint. These tradeoffs appear as a straight line. However, a curved line represents the tradeoffs in many production possibilities frontiers because the law of diminishing returns holds that as we add resources to an area, the marginal gains tend to diminish. Regardless of the specific shape, tradeoffs remain.\nThe third theme is economic efficiency, or getting the most benefit from scarce resources. All choices on the production possibilities frontier show productive efficiency because in such cases, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. Similarly, when an individual makes a choice along a budget constraint, there is no way to increase the quantity of one good without decreasing the quantity of the other. The choice on a production possibilities set that is socially preferred, or the choice on an individual’s budget constraint that is personally preferred, will display allocative efficiency.\nThe basic budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram will recur throughout this book. Some examples include using these tradeoff diagrams to analyze trade, environmental protection and economic output, equality of incomes and economic output, and the macroeconomic tradeoff between consumption and investment. Do not allow the different labels to confuse you. The budget constraint/production possibilities frontier diagram is always just a tool for thinking carefully about scarcity, tradeoffs, and efficiency in a particular situation.\nTwo graphs will occur frequently throughout the text. They represent the possible outcomes of constraints/production of goods. The graph on the left has “Good 2” along the y-axis and “Good 1” along the x-axis. The graph on the right has “Good 1” along the y-axis and “Good 2” along the x-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: The Tradeoff Diagram. Both the individual opportunity set (or budget constraint) and the social production possibilities frontier show the constraints under which individual consumers and society as a whole operate. Both diagrams show the tradeoff in choosing more of one good at the cost of less of the other.\n\n\n\n\n\nThird, self-interested behavior can lead to positive social results. For example, when people work hard to make a living, they create economic output. Consumers who are looking for the best deals will encourage businesses to offer goods and services that meet their needs. Adam Smith, writing in The Wealth of Nations, named this property the invisible hand. In describing how consumers and producers interact in a market economy, Smith wrote:\nEvery individual…generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain. And he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention…By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.\nThe metaphor of the invisible hand suggests the remarkable possibility that broader social good can emerge from selfish individual actions.\nFourth, even people who focus on their own self-interest in the economic part of their life often set aside their own narrow self-interest in other parts of life. For example, you might focus on your own self-interest when asking your employer for a raise or negotiating to buy a car. Then you might turn around and focus on other people when you volunteer to read stories at the local library, help a friend move to a new apartment, or donate money to a charity. Self-interest is a reasonable starting point for analyzing many economic decisions, without needing to imply that people never do anything that is not in their own immediate self-interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCHOICES ... TO WHAT DEGREE?\nWhat have we learned? We know that scarcity impacts all the choices we make. An economist might argue that people do not obtain a bachelor’s or master’s degree because they do not have the resources to make those choices or because their incomes are too low and/or the price of these degrees is too high. A bachelor’s or a master’s degree may not be available in their opportunity set.\nThe price of these degrees may be too high not only because the actual price, college tuition (and perhaps room and board), is too high. An economist might also say that for many people, the full opportunity cost of a bachelor’s or a master’s degree is too high. For these people, they are unwilling or unable to make the tradeoff of forfeiting years of working, and earning an income, to earn a degree.\nFinally, the statistics we introduced at the start of the chapter reveal information about intertemporal choices. An economist might say that people choose not to obtain a college degree because they may have to borrow money to attend college, and the interest they have to pay on that loan in the future will affect their decisions today. Also, it could be that some people have a preference for current consumption over future consumption, so they choose to work now at a lower salary and consume now, rather than postponing that consumption until after they graduate college.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe economic way of thinking provides a useful approach to understanding human behavior.\nEconomists make the careful distinction between positive statements, which describe the world as it is, and normative statements, which describe how the world should be.\nEven when economics analyzes the gains and losses from various events or policies, and thus draws normative conclusions about how the world should be, the analysis of economics is rooted in a positive analysis of how people, firms, and governments actually behave, not how they should behave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals may not act in the rational, calculating way described by the economic model of decision making, measuring utility and costs at the margin, but can you make a case that they behave approximately that way?\nWould an op-ed piece in a newspaper urging the adoption of a particular economic policy be a positive or normative statement?\nWould a research study on the effects of soft drink consumption on children’s cognitive development be a positive or normative statement?\nWhat is the difference between a positive and a normative statement?\nIs the economic model of decision-making intended as a literal description of how individuals, firms, and the governments actually make decisions?\nWhat are four responses to the claim that people should not behave in the way described in this chapter?\nWhat assumptions about the economy must be true for the invisible hand to work? To what extent are those assumptions valid in the real world?\nDo economists have any particular expertise at making normative arguments? In other words, they have expertise at making positive statements (i.e., what will happen) about some economic policy, for example, but do they have special expertise to judge whether or not the policy should be undertaken?",

Demand is based on needs and wants—a consumer may be able to differentiate between a need and a want, but from an economist’s perspective they are the same thing. Demand is also based on ability to pay. If you cannot pay for it, you have no effective demand.\nWhat a buyer pays for a unit of the specific good or service is called price. The total number of units purchased at that price is called the quantity demanded. A rise in price of a good or service almost always decreases the quantity demanded of that good or service. Conversely, a fall in price will increase the quantity demanded. When the price of a gallon of gasoline goes up, for example, people look for ways to reduce their consumption by combining several errands, commuting by carpool or mass transit, or taking weekend or vacation trips closer to home. Economists call this inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded the law of demand. The law of demand assumes that all other variables that affect demand (to be explained in the next module) are held constant.\nAn example from the market for gasoline can be shown in the form of a table or a graph. A table that shows the quantity demanded at each price, such as Table, is called a demand schedule. Price in this case is measured in dollars per gallon of gasoline. The quantity demanded is measured in millions of gallons over some time period (for example, per day or per year) and over some geographic area (like a state or a country).\nA demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded on a graph like Figure 4.1, with quantity on the horizontal axis and the price per gallon on the vertical axis. (Note that this is an exception to the normal rule in mathematics that the independent variable (x) goes on the horizontal axis and the dependent variable (y) goes on the vertical. Economics is not math.)\nThe demand schedule shown by Table and the demand curve shown by the graph in Figure 4.1 are two ways of describing the same relationship between price and quantity demanded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. These points are then graphed, and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D). The downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand—the inverse relationship between prices and quantity demanded.\n\n\n\nDemand curves will appear somewhat different for each product. They may appear relatively steep or flat, or they may be straight or curved. Nearly all demand curves share the fundamental similarity that they slope down from left to right. So demand curves embody the law of demand: As the price increases, the quantity demanded decreases, and conversely, as the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases.\nConfused about these different types of demand? Read the next Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIS DEMAND THE SAME AS QUANTITY DEMANDED?\n\n\n\nIn economic terminology, demand is not the same as quantity demanded. When economists talk about demand, they mean the relationship between a range of prices and the quantities demanded at those prices, as illustrated by a demand curve or a demand schedule. When economists talk about quantity demanded, they mean only a certain point on the demand curve, or one quantity on the demand schedule. In short, demand refers to the curve and quantity demanded refers to the (specific) point on the curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nEconomics seeks to solve the problem of scarcity, which is when human wants for goods and services exceed the available supply.\nA modern economy displays a division of labor, in which people earn income by specializing in what they produce and then use that income to purchase the products they need or want.\nThe division of labor allows individuals and firms to specialize and to produce more for several reasons: a. It allows the agents to focus on areas of advantage due to natural factors and skill levels; b. It encourages the agents to learn and invent; c. It allows agents to take advantage of economies of scale. Division and specialization of labor only work when individuals can purchase what they do not produce in markets. Learning about economics helps you understand the major problems facing the world today, prepares you to be a good citizen, and helps you become a well-rounded thinker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is scarcity?

The result was the demand curve and the supply curve. Price, however, is not the only factor that influences demand, nor is it the only thing that influences supply. For example, how is demand for vegetarian food affected if, say, health concerns cause more consumers to avoid eating meat? How is the supply of diamonds affected if diamond producers discover several new diamond mines? What are the major factors, in addition to the price, that influence demand or supply?\n\n4.2.1 What Factors Affect Demand?\nWe defined demand as the amount of some product a consumer is willing and able to purchase at each price. That suggests at least two factors in addition to price that affect demand. Willingness to purchase suggests a desire, based on what economists call tastes and preferences. If you neither need nor want something, you will not buy it. Ability to purchase suggests that income is important. Professors are usually able to afford better housing and transportation than students, because they have more income. Prices of related goods can affect demand also. If you need a new car, the price of a Honda may affect your demand for a Ford. Finally, the size or composition of the population can affect demand. The more children a family has, the greater their demand for clothing. The more driving-age children a family has, the greater their demand for car insurance, and the less for diapers and baby formula.\nThese factors matter for both individual and market demand as a whole. Exactly how do these various factors affect demand, and how do we show the effects graphically? To answer those questions, we need the ceteris paribus assumption.\n\n\n4.2.2 The Ceteris Paribus Assumption\nA demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables: quantity on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis. The assumption behind a demand curve or a supply curve is that no relevant economic factors, other than the product’s price, are changing. Economists call this assumption ceteris paribus, a Latin phrase meaning “other things being equal.” Any given demand or supply curve is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that all else is held equal. A demand curve or a supply curve is a relationship between two, and only two, variables when all other variables are kept constant. If all else is not held equal, then the laws of supply and demand will not necessarily hold, as the following Clear It Up feature shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHEN DOES CETERIS PARIBUS APPLY?\nWe typically apply ceteris paribus when we observe how changes in price affect demand or supply, but we can apply ceteris paribus more generally. In the real world, demand and supply depend on more factors than just price. For example, a consumer’s demand depends on income and a producer’s supply depends on the cost of producing the product. How can we analyze the effect on demand or supply if multiple factors are changing at the same time—say price rises and income falls? The answer is that we examine the changes one at a time, assuming the other factors are held constant.\nFor example, we can say that an increase in the price reduces the amount consumers will buy (assuming income, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). Additionally, a decrease in income reduces the amount consumers can afford to buy (assuming price, and anything else that affects demand, is unchanged). This is what the ceteris paribus assumption really means. In this particular case, after we analyze each factor separately, we can combine the results. The amount consumers buy falls for two reasons: first because of the higher price and second because of the lower income.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 How Does Income Affect Demand?\nLet’s use income as an example of how factors other than price affect demand. Figure shows the initial demand for automobiles as D0. At point Q, for example, if the price is $20,000 per car, the quantity of cars demanded is 18 million. D0 also shows how the quantity of cars demanded would change as a result of a higher or lower price. For example, if the price of a car rose to $22,000, the quantity demanded would decrease to 17 million, at point R.\nThe original demand curve D0, like every demand curve, is based on the ceteris paribus assumption that no other economically relevant factors change. Now imagine that the economy expands in a way that raises the incomes of many people, making cars more affordable. How will this affect demand? How can we show this graphically?\nReturn to Figure 4.2. The price of cars is still $20,000, but with higher incomes, the quantity demanded has now increased to 20 million cars, shown at point S. As a result of the higher income levels, the demand curve shifts to the right to the new demand curve D1, indicating an increase in demand. Table 4.1 shows clearly that this increased demand would occur at every price, not just the original one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Increased demand means that at every given price, the quantity demanded is higher, so that the demand curve shifts to the right from D0 to D1. Decreased demand means that at every given price, the quantity demanded is lower, so that the demand curve shifts to the left from D0 to D2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Price and Demand Shifts: A Car Example\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nDecrease to D2\nOriginal Quantity Demanded D0\nIncrease to D1\n\n\n\n\n$16,000\n17.6 million\n22.0 million\n24.0 million\n\n\n$18,000\n16.0 million\n20.0 million\n22.0 million\n\n\n$20,000\n14.4 million\n18.0 million\n20.0 million\n\n\n$22,000\n13.6 million\n17.0 million\n19.0 million\n\n\n$24,000\n13.2 million\n16.5 million\n18.5 million\n\n\n$26,000\n12.8 million\n16.0 million\n18.0 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, imagine that the economy slows down so that many people lose their jobs or work fewer hours, reducing their incomes. In this case, the decrease in income would lead to a lower quantity of cars demanded at every given price, and the original demand curve D0 would shift left to D2. The shift from D0 to D2 represents such a decrease in demand: At any given price level, the quantity demanded is now lower. In this example, a price of $20,000 means 18 million cars sold along the original demand curve, but only 14.4 million sold after demand fell.\nWhen a demand curve shifts, it does not mean that the quantity demanded by every individual buyer changes by the same amount. In this example, not everyone would have higher or lower income and not everyone would buy or not buy an additional car. Instead, a shift in a demand curve captures a pattern for the market as a whole.\nIn the previous section, we argued that higher income causes greater demand at every price. This is true for most goods and services. For some—luxury cars, vacations in Europe, and fine jewelry—the effect of a rise in income can be especially pronounced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNormal Good\nA product whose demand rises when income rises, and vice versa, is called a normal good.\n\n\nA few exceptions to this pattern do exist. As incomes rise, many people will buy fewer generic brand groceries and more name brand groceries. They are less likely to buy used cars and more likely to buy new cars. They will be less likely to rent an apartment and more likely to own a home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInferior Good\nA product whose demand falls when income rises, and vice versa, is called an inferior good.\n\n\nIn other words, when income increases, the demand curve shifts to the left.\n\n\n4.2.4 Other Factors That Shift Demand Curves\nIncome is not the only factor that causes a shift in demand. Other factors that change demand include tastes and preferences, the composition or size of the population, the prices of related goods, and even expectations. A change in any one of the underlying factors that determine what quantity people are willing to buy at a given price will cause a shift in demand. Graphically, the new demand curve lies either to the right (an increase) or to the left (a decrease) of the original demand curve. Let’s look at these factors.\n\nChanging Tastes or Preferences\n\nFrom 1980 to 2014, the per-person consumption of chicken by Americans rose from 48 pounds per year to 85 pounds per year, and consumption of beef fell from 77 pounds per year to 54 pounds per year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Changes like these are largely due to movements in taste, which change the quantity of a good demanded at every price: that is, they shift the demand curve for that good, rightward for chicken and leftward for beef.\n\nChanges in the Composition of the Population\n\nThe proportion of elderly citizens in the United States population is rising. It rose from 9.8% in 1970 to 12.6% in 2000, and will be a projected (by the U.S. Census Bureau) 20% of the population by 2030. A society with relatively more children, like the United States in the 1960s, will have greater demand for goods and services like tricycles and day care facilities. A society with relatively more elderly persons, as the United States is projected to have by 2030, has a higher demand for nursing homes and hearing aids. Similarly, changes in the size of the population can affect the demand for housing and many other goods. Each of these changes in demand will be shown as a shift in the demand curve.\n\nChanges in the prices of related goods,\n\nsuch as substitutes or complements also can affect the demand for a product. A substitute is a good or service that we can use in place of another good or service. As electronic books, like this one, become more available, you would expect to see a decrease in demand for traditional printed books. A lower price for a substitute decreases demand for the other product. For example, in recent years as the price of tablet computers has fallen, the quantity demanded has increased (because of the law of demand). Since people are purchasing tablets, there has been a decrease in demand for laptops, which we can show graphically as a leftward shift in the demand curve for laptops. A higher price for a substitute good has the reverse effect. Other goods are complements for each other, meaning we often use the goods together, because consumption of one good tends to enhance consumption of the other. Examples include breakfast cereal and milk; notebooks and pens or pencils, golf balls and golf clubs; gasoline and sport utility vehicles; and the five-way combination of bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, and bread. If the price of golf clubs rises, since the quantity demanded of golf clubs falls (because of the law of demand), demand for a complement good like golf balls decreases, too. Similarly, a higher price for skis would shift the demand curve for a complement good like ski resort trips to the left, while a lower price for a complement has the reverse effect.\n\nChanges in Expectations about Future Prices or Other Factors that Affect Demand\n\nWhile it is clear that the price of a good affects the quantity demanded, it is also true that expectations about the future price (or expectations about tastes and preferences, income, and so on) can affect demand. For example, if people hear that a hurricane is coming, they may rush to the store to buy flashlight batteries and bottled water. If people learn that the price of a good like coffee is likely to rise in the future, they may head for the store to stock up on coffee now. We show these changes in demand as shifts in the curve. Therefore, a shift in demand happens when a change in some economic factor (other than price) causes a different quantity to be demanded at every price. The following Work It Out feature shows how this happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSHIFT IN DEMAND\nA shift in demand means that at any price (and at every price), the quantity demanded will be different than it was before. Following is an example of a shift in demand due to an income increase.\n\nStep 1. Draw the graph of a demand curve for a normal good like pizza. Pick\n\na price (like P0). Identify the corresponding Q0. See an example in Figure 4.3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: We can use the demand curve to identify how much consumers would buy at any given price.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. Suppose income increases. As a result of the change, are consumers\n\ngoing to buy more or less pizza? The answer is more. Draw a dotted horizontal line from the chosen price, through the original quantity demanded, to the new point with the new Q1. Draw a dotted vertical line down to the horizontal axis and label the new Q1. Figure 4.4 provides an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities, pushing demand to the right.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3. Now, shift the curve through the new point. You will see that an\n\nincrease in income causes an upward (or rightward) shift in the demand curve, so that at any price the quantities demanded will be higher, as Figure 4.5 illustrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities, pushing demand to the right, and causing the demand curve to shift right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.5 Summing Up Factors That Change Demand\nFigure 4.6 summarizes six factors that can shift demand curves. The direction of the arrows indicates whether the demand curve shifts represent an increase in demand or a decrease in demand. Notice that a change in the price of the good or service itself is not listed among the factors that can shift a demand curve. A change in the price of a good or service causes a movement along a specific demand curve, and it typically leads to some change in the quantity demanded, but it does not shift the demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: Panel (a) shows a list of factors that can cause an increase in demand from D0 to D1. Panel (b) shows the same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D0 to D1.\n\n\n\nWhen a demand curve shifts, it will then intersect with a given supply curve at a different equilibrium price and quantity. We are, however, getting ahead of our story. Before discussing how changes in demand can affect equilibrium price and quantity, we first need to discuss shifts in supply curves.\n\n\n4.2.6 How Production Costs Affect Supply\nA supply curve shows how quantity supplied will change as the price rises and falls, assuming ceteris paribus so that no other economically relevant factors are changing. If other factors relevant to supply do change, then the entire supply curve will shift. Just as we described a shift in demand as a change in the quantity demanded at every price, a shift in supply means a change in the quantity supplied at every price.\nIn thinking about the factors that affect supply, remember what motivates firms: profits, which are the difference between revenues and costs. A firm produces goods and services using combinations of labor, materials, and machinery, or what we call inputs or factors of production. If a firm faces lower costs of production, while the prices for the good or service the firm produces remain unchanged, a firm’s profits go up. When a firm’s profits increase, it is more motivated to produce output, since the more it produces the more profit it will earn. When costs of production fall, a firm will tend to supply a larger quantity at any given price for its output. We can show this by the supply curve shifting to the right.\nTake, for example, a messenger company that delivers packages around a city. The company may find that buying gasoline is one of its main costs. If the price of gasoline falls, then the company will find it can deliver messages more cheaply than before. Since lower costs correspond to higher profits, the messenger company may now supply more of its services at any given price. For example, given the lower gasoline prices, the company can now serve a greater area, and increase its supply.\nConversely, if a firm faces higher costs of production, then it will earn lower profits at any given selling price for its products. As a result, a higher cost of production typically causes a firm to supply a smaller quantity at any given price. In this case, the supply curve shifts to the left.\nConsider the supply for cars, shown by curve S0 in Figure 4.7. Point J indicates that if the price is $20,000, the quantity supplied will be 18 million cars. If the price rises to $22,000 per car, ceteris paribus, the quantity supplied will rise to 20 million cars, as point K on the S0 curve shows. We can show the same information in table form, as in Table 4.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Decreased supply means that at every given price, the quantity supplied is lower, so that the supply curve shifts to the left, from S0 to S1. Increased supply means that at every given price, the quantity supplied is higher, so that the supply curve shifts to the right, from S0 to S2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.2: Price and Shifts in Supply: A Car Example\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nDecrease to S1\nOriginal Quantity Supplied S0\nIncrease to S2\n\n\n\n\n$16,000\n10.5 million\n12.0 million\n13.2 million\n\n\n$18,000\n13.5 million\n15.0 million\n16.5 million\n\n\n$20,000\n16.5 million\n18.0 million\n19.8 million\n\n\n$22,000\n18.5 million\n20.0 million\n22.0 million\n\n\n$24,000\n19.5 million\n21.0 million\n23.1 million\n\n\n$26,000\n20.5 million\n22.0 million\n24.2 million\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, imagine that the price of steel, an important ingredient in manufacturing cars, rises, so that producing a car has become more expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers will react by supplying a lower quantity. We can show this graphically as a leftward shift of supply, from S0 to S1, which indicates that at any given price, the quantity supplied decreases. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied decreases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S0) to 16.5 million on the supply curve S1, which is labeled as point L.\nConversely, if the price of steel decreases, producing a car becomes less expensive. At any given price for selling cars, car manufacturers can now expect to earn higher profits, so they will supply a higher quantity. The shift of supply to the right, from S0 to S2, means that at all prices, the quantity supplied has increased. In this example, at a price of $20,000, the quantity supplied increases from 18 million on the original supply curve (S0) to 19.8 million on the supply curve S2, which is labeled M.\n\n\n4.2.7 Other Factors That Affect Supply\nIn the example above, we saw that changes in the prices of inputs in the production process will affect the cost of production and thus the supply. Several other things affect the cost of production, too, such as changes in weather or other natural conditions, new technologies for production, and some government policies.\nChanges in weather and climate will affect the cost of production for many agricultural products. For example, in 2014 the Manchurian Plain in Northeastern China, which produces most of the country's wheat, corn, and soybeans, experienced its most severe drought in 50 years. A drought decreases the supply of agricultural products, which means that at any given price, a lower quantity will be supplied. Conversely, especially good weather would shift the supply curve to the right.\nWhen a firm discovers a new technology that allows the firm to produce at a lower cost, the supply curve will shift to the right, as well. For instance, in the 1960s a major scientific effort nicknamed the Green Revolution focused on breeding improved seeds for basic crops like wheat and rice. By the early 1990s, more than two-thirds of the wheat and rice in low-income countries around the world used these Green Revolution seeds—and the harvest was twice as high per acre. A technological improvement that reduces costs of production will shift supply to the right, so that a greater quantity will be produced at any given price.\nGovernment policies can affect the cost of production and the supply curve through taxes, regulations, and subsidies. For example, the U.S. government imposes a tax on alcoholic beverages that collects about $8 billion per year from producers. Businesses treat taxes as costs. Higher costs decrease supply for the reasons we discussed above. Other examples of policy that can affect cost are the wide array of government regulations that require firms to spend money to provide a cleaner environment or a safer workplace. Complying with regulations increases costs.\nA government subsidy, on the other hand, is the opposite of a tax. A subsidy occurs when the government pays a firm directly or reduces the firm’s taxes if the firm carries out certain actions. From the firm’s perspective, taxes or regulations are an additional cost of production that shifts supply to the left, leading the firm to produce a lower quantity at every given price. Government subsidies reduce the cost of production and increase supply at every given price, shifting supply to the right. The following Work It Out feature shows how this shift happens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSHIFT IN SUPPLY\nWe know that a supply curve shows the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output. What happens to the supply curve when the cost of production goes up? Following is an example of a shift in supply due to a production cost increase.\n\nStep 1.\n\nDraw a graph of a supply curve for pizza. Pick a quantity (like Q0). If you draw a vertical line up from Q0 to the supply curve, you will see the price the firm chooses. Figure 4.8`{.interpreted-text role=“numref”} provides an example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: You can use a supply curve to show the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.\n\n\n\n\nStep 2.\n\nWhy did the firm choose that price and not some other? One way to think about this is that the price is composed of two parts. The first part is the cost of producing pizzas at the margin; in this case, the cost of producing the pizza, including cost of ingredients (e.g., dough, sauce, cheese, and pepperoni), the cost of the pizza oven, the shop rent, and the workers' wages. The second part is the firm’s desired profit, which is determined, among other factors, by the profit margins in that particular business. If you add these two parts together, you get the price the firm wishes to charge. The quantity Q0 and associated price P0 give you one point on the firm’s supply curve, as Figure 4.9 illustrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: The cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a product.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3.\n\nNow, suppose that the cost of production increases. Perhaps cheese has become more expensive by $0.75 per pizza. If that is true, the firm will want to raise its price by the amount of the increase in cost ($0.75). Draw this point on the supply curve directly above the initial point on the curve, but $0.75 higher, as Figure 4.10 shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: Because the cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a product, if the cost of production increases, the price for the product will also need to increase.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4.\n\nShift the supply curve through this point. You will see that an increase in cost causes an upward (or a leftward) shift of the supply curve so that at any price, the quantities supplied will be smaller, as Figure 4.11 illustrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: When the cost of production increases, the supply curve shifts upwardly to a new price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2.8 Summing Up Factors That Change Supply\nChanges in the cost of inputs, natural disasters, new technologies, and the impact of government decisions all affect the cost of production. In turn, these factors affect how much firms are willing to supply at any given price.\nFigure 4.12 summarizes factors that change the supply of goods and services. Notice that a change in the price of the product itself is not among the factors that shift the supply curve.\nAlthough a change in price of a good or service typically causes a change in quantity supplied or a movement along the supply curve for that specific good or service, it does not cause the supply curve itself to shift.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.12: Panel (a) shows a list of factors that can cause an increase in supply from S0 to S1. Panel (b) shows the same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in supply from S0 to S1.\n\n\n\nBecause demand and supply curves appear on a two-dimensional diagram with only price and quantity on the axes, an unwary visitor to the land of economics might be fooled into believing that economics is about only four topics: demand, supply, price, and quantity.\nHowever, demand and supply are really “umbrella” concepts: demand covers all the factors that affect demand, and supply covers all the factors that affect supply. We include factors other than price that affect demand and supply are included by using shifts in the demand or the supply curve. In this way, the two-dimensional demand and supply model becomes a powerful tool for analyzing a wide range of economic circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nEconomists often use the ceteris paribus or “other things being equal” assumption: while examining the economic impact of one event, all other factors remain unchanged for analysis purposes. Factors that can shift the demand curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be demanded at any given price, include changes in tastes, population, income, prices of substitute or complement goods, and expectations about future conditions and prices.\nFactors that can shift the supply curve for goods and services, causing a different quantity to be supplied at any given price, include input prices, natural conditions, changes in technology, and government taxes, regulations, or subsidies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do economists use the ceteris paribus assumption?\nIn an analysis of the market for paint, an economist discovers the facts listed below. State whether each of these changes will affect supply or demand, and in what direction. a. There have recently been some important cost-saving inventions in the technology for making paint. b. Paint is lasting longer, so that property owners need not repaint as often. c. Because of severe hailstorms, many people need to repaint now.\n\n\nThe hailstorms damaged several factories that make paint, forcing them to close down for several months.\n\n\nWhen analyzing a market, how do economists deal with the problem that many factors that affect the market are changing at the same time?\nName some factors that can cause a shift in the demand curve in markets for goods and services.\nName some factors that can cause a shift in the supply curve in markets for goods and services.",

It might be an event that affects demand, like a change in income, population, tastes, prices of substitutes or complements, or expectations about future prices. It might be an event that affects supply, like a change in natural conditions, input prices, or technology, or government policies that affect production. How does this economic event affect equilibrium price and quantity? We will analyze this question using a four-step process.\n\nStep 1.\n\nDraw a demand and supply model before the economic change took place. To establish the model requires four standard pieces of information: The law of demand, which tells us the slope of the demand curve; the law of supply, which gives us the slope of the supply curve; the shift variables for demand; and the shift variables for supply. From this model, find the initial equilibrium values for price and quantity.\n\nStep 2.\n\nDecide whether the economic change you are analyzing affects demand or supply. In other words, does the event refer to something in the list of demand factors or supply factors?\n\nStep 3.\n\nDecide whether the effect on demand or supply causes the curve to shift to the right or to the left, and sketch the new demand or supply curve on the diagram. In other words, does the event increase or decrease the amount consumers want to buy or producers want to sell?\n\nStep 4.\n\nIdentify the new equilibrium and then compare the original equilibrium price and quantity to the new equilibrium price and quantity.\n\n\nLet’s consider one example that involves a shift in supply and one that involves a shift in demand. Then we will consider an example where both supply and demand shift.\n\n4.3.1 Good Weather for Salmon Fishing\nSupposed that during the summer of 2015, weather conditions were excellent for commercial salmon fishing off the California coast. Heavy rains meant higher than normal levels of water in the rivers, which helps the salmon to breed. Slightly cooler ocean temperatures stimulated the growth of plankton, the microscopic organisms at the bottom of the ocean food chain, providing everything in the ocean with a hearty food supply. The ocean stayed calm during fishing season, so commercial fishing operations did not lose many days to bad weather.\nHow did these climate conditions affect the quantity and price of salmon? Figure 4.13 illustrates the four-step approach, which we explain below, to work through this problem. Table 4.3 also provides the information to work the problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.13: Unusually good weather leads to changes in the price and quantity of salmon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.3: Salmon Fishing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice per Pound\nQuantity Supplied in 2014\nQuantity Supplied in 2015\nQuantity Demanded\n\n\n\n\n$2.00\n\n80\n\n400\n840\n\n\n$2.25\n120\n480\n680\n\n\n$2.50\n160\n550\n550\n\n\n$2.75\n200\n600\n450\n\n\n$3.00\n230\n640\n350\n\n\n$3.25\n250\n670\n250\n\n\n$3.50\n270\n700\n200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.\n\nDraw a demand and supply model to illustrate the market for salmon in the year before the good weather conditions began. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show that the original equilibrium price is $3.25 per pound and the original equilibrium quantity is 250,000 fish. (This price per pound is what commercial buyers pay at the fishing docks. What consumers pay at the grocery is higher.)\n\nStep 2.\n\nDid the economic event affect supply or demand? Good weather is an example of a natural condition that affects supply.\n\nStep 3.\n\nWas the effect on supply an increase or a decrease? Good weather is a change in natural conditions that increases the quantity supplied at any given price. The supply curve shifts to the right, moving from the original supply curve S0 to the new supply curve S1, which Figure 4.13 and Table 4.3 show.\n\nStep 4.\n\nCompare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium. At the new equilibrium E1, the equilibrium price falls from $3.25 to $2.50, but the equilibrium quantity increases from 250,000 to 550,000 salmon. Notice that the equilibrium quantity demanded increased, even though the demand curve did not move.\n\n\nIn short, good weather conditions increased supply of the California commercial salmon. The result was a higher equilibrium quantity of salmon bought and sold in the market at a lower price.\n\n\n4.3.2 Newspapers and the Internet\nAccording to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, increasingly more people, especially younger people, are obtaining their news from online and digital sources. The majority of U.S. adults now own smartphones or tablets, and most of those Americans say they use them in part to access the news.\nFrom 2004 to 2012, the share of Americans who reported obtaining their news from digital sources increased from 24% to 39%. How has this affected consumption of print news media, and radio and television news? Figure 4.14 and the text below illustrates using the four-step analysis to answer this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.14: A change in tastes from print news sources to digital sources results in a leftward shift in demand for the former. The result is a decrease in both equilibrium price and quantity.\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.\n\nDevelop a demand and supply model to think about what the market looked like before the event. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. In this case, we perform the analysis without specific numbers on the price and quantity axis.\n\nStep 2.\n\nDid the described change affect supply or demand? A change in tastes, from traditional news sources (print, radio, and television) to digital sources, caused a change in demand for the former.\n\nStep 3.\n\nWas the effect on demand positive or negative? A shift to digital news sources will tend to mean a lower quantity demanded of traditional news sources at every given price, causing the demand curve for print and other traditional news sources to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.\n\nStep 4.\n\nCompare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).\n\n\nThe decline in print news reading predates 2004. Print newspaper circulation peaked in 1973 and has declined since then due to competition from television and radio news. In 1991, 55% of Americans indicated they received their news from print sources, while only 29% did so in 2012. Radio news has followed a similar path in recent decades, with the share of Americans obtaining their news from radio declining from 54% in 1991 to 33% in 2012.\nTelevision news has held its own over the last 15 years, with a market share staying in the mid to upper fifties. What does this suggest for the future, given that two-thirds of Americans under 30 years old say they do not obtain their news from television at all?\n\n\n4.3.3 The Interconnections and Speed of Adjustment in Real Markets\nIn the real world, many factors that affect demand and supply can change all at once. For example, the demand for cars might increase because of rising incomes and population, and it might decrease because of rising gasoline prices (a complementary good). Likewise, the supply of cars might increase because of innovative new technologies that reduce the cost of car production, and it might decrease as a result of new government regulations requiring the installation of costly pollution-control technology.\nMoreover, rising incomes and population or changes in gasoline prices will affect many markets, not just cars. How can an economist sort out all these interconnected events? The answer lies in the ceteris paribus assumption. Look at how each economic event affects each market, one event at a time, holding all else constant. Then combine the analyses to see the net effect.\n\n\n4.3.4 A Combined Example\nThe U.S. Postal Service is facing difficult challenges. Compensation for postal workers tends to increase most years due to cost-of-living increases. At the same time, increasingly more people are using email, text, and other digital message forms such as Facebook and Twitter to communicate with friends and others.\nWhat does this suggest about the continued viability of the Postal Service? Figure 4.15 and the text below illustrate this using the four-step analysis to answer this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.15: Panel (a) shows higher labor compensation causes a leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium price. Panel (b) shows a change in tastes away from Postal Services causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium price.\n\n\n\nSince this problem involves two disturbances, we need two four-step analyses, the first to analyze the effects of higher compensation for postal workers, the second to analyze the effects of many people switching from “snail mail” to email and other digital messages.\nFigure 4.15 (a) shows the shift in supply discussed in the following steps.\n\nStep 1.\n\nDraw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for the U.S. Postal Service looked like before this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships.\n\nStep 2.\n\nDid the described change affect supply or demand? Labor compensation is a cost of production. A change in production costs caused a change in supply for the Postal Service.\n\nStep 3.\n\nWas the effect on supply positive or negative? Higher labor compensation leads to a lower quantity supplied of postal services at every given price, causing the supply curve for postal services to shift to the left, from S0 to S1.\n\nStep 4.\n\nCompare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at a lower quantity and a higher price than the original equilibrium (E0).\n\n\nFigure 4.15 (b) shows the shift in demand in the following steps.\n\nStep 1.\n\nDraw a demand and supply model to illustrate what the market for U.S. Postal Services looked like before this scenario starts. The demand curve D0 and the supply curve S0 show the original relationships. Note that this diagram is independent from the diagram in panel (a).\n\nStep 2.\n\nDid the change described affect supply or demand? A change in tastes away from snail mail toward digital messages will cause a change in demand for the Postal Service.\n\nStep 3.\n\nWas the effect on demand positive or negative? A change in tastes away from snailmail toward digital messages causes lower quantity demanded of postal services at every given price, causing the demand curve for postal services to shift to the left, from D0 to D1.\n\nStep 4.\n\nCompare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original equilibrium price. The new equilibrium (E2) occurs at a lower quantity and a lower price than the original equilibrium (E0).\n\n\nThe final step in a scenario where both supply and demand shift is to combine the two individual analyses to determine what happens to the equilibrium quantity and price. Graphically, we superimpose the previous two diagrams one on top of the other, as in Figure 4.16.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.16: Supply and demand shifts cause changes in equilibrium price and quantity.\n\n\n\nFollowing are the results:\n\nEffect on Quantity:\n\nThe effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services because it raises the cost of production is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium quantity. Since both shifts are to the left, the overall impact is a decrease in the equilibrium quantity of Postal Services (Q3). This is easy to see graphically, since Q3 is to the left of Q0.\n\nEffect on Price:\n\nThe overall effect on price is more complicated. The effect of higher labor compensation on Postal Services, because it raises the cost of production, is to increase the equilibrium price. The effect of a change in tastes away from snail mail is to decrease the equilibrium price. Since the two effects are in opposite directions, unless we know the magnitudes of the two effects, the overall effect is unclear. This is not unusual. When both curves shift, typically we can determine the overall effect on price or on quantity, but not on both. In this case, we determined the overall effect on the equilibrium quantity, but not on the equilibrium price. In other cases, it might be the opposite.\n\n\nThe next Clear It Up feature focuses on the difference between shifts of supply or demand and movements along a curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SHIFTS OF DEMAND OR SUPPLY VERSUS MOVEMENTS ALONG A DEMAND OR SUPPLY CURVE?\nOne common mistake in applying the demand and supply framework is to confuse the shift of a demand or a supply curve with movement along a demand or supply curve. As an example, consider a problem that asks whether a drought will increase or decrease the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price of wheat. Lee, a student in an introductory economics class, might reason:\n“Well, it is clear that a drought reduces supply, so I will shift back the supply curve, as in the shift from the original supply curve S0 to S1 on the diagram (Shift 1). The equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the equilibrium quantity is lower and the equilibrium price is higher. Then, a higher price makes farmers more likely to supply the good, so the supply curve shifts right, as shows the shift from S1 to S2, shows on the diagram (Shift 2), so that the equilibrium now moves from E1 to E2. The higher price, however, also reduces demand and so causes demand to shift back, like the shift from the original demand curve, D0 to D1 on the diagram (labeled Shift 3), and the equilibrium moves from E2 to E3.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.17: A shift in one curve never causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve causes a movement along the second curve.\n\n\n\nAt about this point, Lee suspects that this answer is headed down the wrong path. Think about what might be wrong with Lee’s logic, and then read the answer that follows.\nAnswer: Lee’s first step is correct: that is, a drought shifts back the supply curve of wheat and leads to a prediction of a lower equilibrium quantity and a higher equilibrium price. This corresponds to a movement along the original demand curve (D0), from E0 to E1. The rest of Lee’s argument is wrong, because it mixes up shifts in supply with quantity supplied, and shifts in demand with quantity demanded. A higher or lower price never shifts the supply curve, as suggested by the shift in supply from S1 to S2. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given supply curve. Similarly, a higher or lower price never shifts a demand curve, as suggested in the shift from D0 to D1. Instead, a price change leads to a movement along a given demand curve. Remember, a change in the price of a good never causes the demand or supply curve for that good to shift.\nThink carefully about the timeline of events: What happens first, what happens next? What is cause, what is effect? If you keep the order right, you are more likely to get the analysis correct.\n\n\nIn the four-step analysis of how economic events affect equilibrium price and quantity, the movement from the old to the new equilibrium seems immediate. As a practical matter, however, prices and quantities often do not zoom straight to equilibrium. More realistically, when an economic event causes demand or supply to shift, prices and quantities set off in the general direction of equilibrium. Even as they are moving toward one new equilibrium, a subsequent change in demand or supply often pushes prices toward another equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\nWhen using the supply and demand framework to think about how an event will affect the equilibrium price and quantity, proceed through four steps: (1) sketch a supply and demand diagram to think about what the market looked like before the event; (2) decide whether the event will affect supply or demand; (3) decide whether the effect on supply or demand is negative or positive, and draw the appropriate shifted supply or demand curve; (4) compare the new equilibrium price and quantity to the original ones.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s think about the market for air travel. From August 2014 to January 2015, the price of jet fuel decreased roughly 47%. Using the four-step analysis, how do you think this fuel price decrease affected the equilibrium price and quantity of air travel?\nA tariff is a tax on imported goods. Suppose the U.S. government cuts the tariff on imported flat screen televisions. Using the four-step analysis, how do you think the tariff reduction will affect the equilibrium price and quantity of flat screen TVs?\nHow does one analyze a market where both demand and supply shift?\nWhat causes a movement along the demand curve? What causes a movement along the supply curve?",

    "text": "4.4 Price Ceilings and Price Floors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain price controls, price ceilings, and price floors\nAnalyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism\n\n\n\nTo this point in the chapter, we have been assuming that markets are free, that is, they operate with no government intervention. In this section, we will explore the outcomes, both anticipated and otherwise, when government does intervene in a market either to prevent the price of some good or service from rising “too high” or to prevent the price of some good or service from falling “too low”.\nEconomists believe there are a small number of fundamental principles that explain how economic agents respond in different situations. Two of these principles, which we have already introduced, are the laws of demand and supply.\nGovernments can pass laws affecting market outcomes, but no law can negate these economic principles. Rather, the principles will become apparent in sometimes unexpected ways, which may undermine the intent of the government policy. This is one of the major conclusions of this section.\nControversy sometimes surrounds the prices and quantities established by demand and supply, especially for products that are considered necessities. In some cases, discontent over prices turns into public pressure on politicians, who may then pass legislation to prevent a certain price from climbing “too high” or falling “too low.”\nThe demand and supply model shows how people and firms will react to the incentives that these laws provide to control prices, in ways that will often lead to undesirable consequences. Alternative policy tools can often achieve the desired goals of price control laws, while avoiding at least some of their costs and tradeoffs.\n\n4.4.1 Price Ceilings\nLaws that government enact to regulate prices are called price controls. Price controls come in two flavors. A price ceiling keeps a price from rising above a certain level (the “ceiling”), while a price floor keeps a price from falling below a given level (the “floor”). This section uses the demand and supply framework to analyze price ceilings. The next section discusses price floors.\nA price ceiling is a legal maximum price that one pays for some good or service. A government imposes price ceilings in order to keep the price of some necessary good or service affordable. For example, in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, the price of bottled water increased above $5 per gallon. As a result, many people called for price controls on bottled water to prevent the price from rising so high. In this particular case, the government did not impose a price ceiling, but there are other examples of where price ceilings did occur.\nIn many markets for goods and services, demanders outnumber suppliers. Consumers, who are also potential voters, sometimes unite behind a political proposal to hold down a certain price. In some cities, such as Albany, renters have pressed political leaders to pass rent control laws, a price ceiling that usually works by stating that landlords can raise rents by only a certain maximum percentage each year. Some of the best examples of rent control occur in urban areas such as New York, Washington D.C., or San Francisco.\nRent control becomes a politically hot topic when rents begin to rise rapidly. Everyone needs an affordable place to live. Perhaps a change in tastes makes a certain suburb or town a more popular place to live. Perhaps locally-based businesses expand, bringing higher incomes and more people into the area. Such changes can cause a change in the demand for rental housing, as Figure 4.18 illustrates.\nThe original equilibrium (E0) lies at the intersection of supply curve S0 and demand curve D0, corresponding to an equilibrium price of $500 and an equilibrium quantity of 15,000 units of rental housing. The effect of greater income or a change in tastes is to shift the demand curve for rental housing to the right, as the data in Table 4.4 shows and the shift from D0 to D1 on the graph. In this market, at the new equilibrium E1, the price of a rental unit would rise to $600 and the equilibrium quantity would increase to 17,000 units.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.18: The original intersection of demand and supply occurs at E0. If demand shifts from D0 to D1, the new equilibrium would be at E1—unless a price ceiling prevents the price from rising. If the price is not permitted to rise, the quantity supplied remains at 15,000. However, after the change in demand, the quantity demanded rises to 19,000, resulting in a shortage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.4: Rent Control\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nOriginal Quantity Supplied\nOriginal Quantity Demanded\nNew Quantity Demanded\n\n\n\n\n$400\n12,000\n18,000\n23,000\n\n\n$500\n15,000\n15,000\n19,000\n\n\n$600\n17,000\n13,000\n17,000\n\n\n$700\n19,000\n11,000\n15,000\n\n\n$800\n20,000\n10,000\n14,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that a city government passes a rent control law to keep the price at the original equilibrium of $500 for a typical apartment. In Figure 4.18, the horizontal line at the price of $500 shows the legally fixed maximum price set by the rent control law. However, the underlying forces that shifted the demand curve to the right are still there.\nAt that price ($500), the quantity supplied remains at the same 15,000 rental units, but the quantity demanded is 19,000 rental units. In other words, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, so there is a shortage of rental housing. One of the ironies of price ceilings is that while the price ceiling was intended to help renters, there are actually fewer apartments rented out under the price ceiling (15,000 rental units) than would be the case at the market rent of $600 (17,000 rental units).\nPrice ceilings do not simply benefit renters at the expense of landlords. Rather, some renters (or potential renters) lose their housing as landlords convert apartments to co-ops and condos. Even when the housing remains in the rental market, landlords tend to spend less on maintenance and on essentials like heating, cooling, hot water, and lighting. The first rule of economics is you do not get something for nothing—everything has an opportunity cost. Thus, if renters obtain “cheaper” housing than the market requires, they tend to also end up with lower quality housing.\nPrice ceilings are enacted in an attempt to keep prices low for those who need the product. However, when the market price is not allowed to rise to the equilibrium level, quantity demanded exceeds quantity supplied, and thus a shortage occurs. Those who manage to purchase the product at the lower price given by the price ceiling will benefit, but sellers of the product will suffer, along with those who are not able to purchase the product at all. Quality is also likely to deteriorate.\n\n\n4.4.2 Price Floors\nA price floor is the lowest price that one can legally pay for some good or service. Perhaps the best-known example of a price floor is the minimum wage, which is based on the view that someone working full time should be able to afford a basic standard of living. The federal minimum wage in 2016 was $7.25 per hour, although some states and localities have a higher minimum wage. The federal minimum wage yields an annual income for a single person of $15,080, which is slightly higher than the Federal poverty line of $11,880. As the cost of living rises over time, the Congress periodically raises the federal minimum wage.\nPrice floors are sometimes called “price supports,” because they support a price by preventing it from falling below a certain level. Around the world, many countries have passed laws to create agricultural price supports. Farm prices and thus farm incomes fluctuate, sometimes widely. Even if, on average, farm incomes are adequate, some years they can be quite low. The purpose of price supports is to prevent these swings.\nThe most common way price supports work is that the government enters the market and buys up the product, adding to demand to keep prices higher than they otherwise would be. According to the Common Agricultural Policy reform passed in 2013, the European Union (EU) will spend about 60 billion euros per year, or 67 billion dollars per year (with the November 2016 exchange rate), or roughly 38% of the EU budget, on price supports for Europe’s farmers from 2014 to 2020.\nFigure 4.19 illustrates the effects of a government program that assures a price above the equilibrium by focusing on the market for wheat in Europe. In the absence of government intervention, the price would adjust so that the quantity supplied would equal the quantity demanded at the equilibrium point E0, with price P0 and quantity Q0. However, policies to keep prices high for farmers keeps the price above what would have been the market equilibrium level—the price Pf shown by the dashed horizontal line in the diagram. The result is a quantity supplied in excess of the quantity demanded (Qd). When quantity supplied exceeds quantity demanded, a surplus exists.\nEconomists estimate that the high-income areas of the world, including the United States, Europe, and Japan, spend roughly $1 billion per day in supporting their farmers. If the government is willing to purchase the excess supply (or to provide payments for others to purchase it), then farmers will benefit from the price floor, but taxpayers and consumers of food will pay the costs. Agricultural economists and policy makers have offered numerous proposals for reducing farm subsidies. In many countries, however, political support for subsidies for farmers remains strong. This is either because the population views this as supporting the traditional rural way of life or because of industry's lobbying power of the agro-business.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.19: The intersection of demand (D) and supply (S) would be at the equilibrium point E0. However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above E0 and prevents it from falling. The result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied Qs exceeds the quantity demanded Qd. There is excess supply, also called a surplus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nPrice ceilings prevent a price from rising above a certain level. When a price ceiling is set below the equilibrium price, quantity demanded will exceed quantity supplied, and excess demand or shortages will result. Price floors prevent a price from falling below a certain level.\nWhen a price floor is set above the equilibrium price, quantity supplied will exceed quantity demanded, and excess supply or surpluses will result. Price floors and price ceilings often lead to unintended consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the effect of a price ceiling on the quantity demanded of the product?

    "text": "4.5 Demand, Supply, and Efficiency\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nContrast consumer surplus, producer surplus, and social surplus\nExplain why price floors and price ceilings can be inefficient\nAnalyze demand and supply as a social adjustment mechanism\n\n\n\nThe familiar demand and supply diagram holds within it the concept of economic efficiency. One typical way that economists define efficiency is when it is impossible to improve the situation of one party without imposing a cost on another. Conversely, if a situation is inefficient, it becomes possible to benefit at least one party without imposing costs on others.\nEfficiency in the demand and supply model has the same basic meaning: The economy is getting as much benefit as possible from its scarce resources and all the possible gains from trade have been achieved. In other words, the optimal amount of each good and service is produced and consumed.\n\n4.5.1 Consumer Surplus, Producer Surplus, Social Surplus\nConsider a market for tablet computers, as Figure 4.20 shows. The equilibrium price is $80 and the equilibrium quantity is 28 million. To see the benefits to consumers, look at the segment of the demand curve above the equilibrium point and to the left. This portion of the demand curve shows that at least some demanders would have been willing to pay more than $80 for a tablet.\nFor example, point J shows that if the price were $90, 20 million tablets would be sold. Those consumers who would have been willing to pay $90 for a tablet based on the utility they expect to receive from it, but who were able to pay the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received a benefit beyond what they had to pay. Remember, the demand curve traces consumers’ willingness to pay for different quantities. The amount that individuals would have been willing to pay, minus the amount that they actually paid, is called consumer surplus. Consumer surplus is the area labeled F—that is, the area above the market price and below the demand curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.20: The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows that, even at the price of $90, consumers would have been willing to purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many of the producers were willing to accept for their products. For example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45, firms would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million.\n\n\n\nThe supply curve shows the quantity that firms are willing to supply at each price. For example, point K in Figure illustrates that, at $45, firms would still have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million. Those producers who would have been willing to supply the tablets at $45, but who were instead able to charge the equilibrium price of $80, clearly received an extra benefit beyond what they required to supply the product. The amount that a seller is paid for a good minus the seller’s actual cost is called producer surplus. In Figure, producer surplus is the area labeled G—that is, the area between the market price and the segment of the supply curve below the equilibrium.\nThe sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus is social surplus, also referred to as economic surplus or total surplus. In Figure we show social surplus as the area F + G. Social surplus is larger at equilibrium quantity and price than it would be at any other quantity. This demonstrates the economic efficiency of the market equilibrium. In addition, at the efficient level of output, it is impossible to produce greater consumer surplus without reducing producer surplus, and it is impossible to produce greater producer surplus without reducing consumer surplus.\n\n\n4.5.2 Inefficiency of Price Floors and Price Ceilings\nThe imposition of a price floor or a price ceiling will prevent a market from adjusting to its equilibrium price and quantity, and thus will create an inefficient outcome. However, there is an additional twist here. Along with creating inefficiency, price floors and ceilings will also transfer some consumer surplus to producers, or some producer surplus to consumers.\nImagine that several firms develop a promising but expensive new drug for treating back pain. If this therapy is left to the market, the equilibrium price will be $600 per month and 20,000 people will use the drug, as shown in Figure (a). The original level of consumer surplus is T + U and producer surplus is V + W + X. However, the government decides to impose a price ceiling of $400 to make the drug more affordable. At this price ceiling, firms in the market now produce only 15,000.\nAs a result, two changes occur. First, an inefficient outcome occurs and the total surplus of society is reduced. The loss in social surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity is called deadweight loss. In a very real sense, it is like money thrown away that benefits no one. In Figure 4.21 (a), the deadweight loss is the area U + W. When deadweight loss exists, it is possible for both consumer and producer surplus to be higher, in this case because the price control is blocking some suppliers and demanders from transactions they would both be willing to make.\nA second change from the price ceiling is that some of the producer surplus is transferred to consumers. After the price ceiling is imposed, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. In other words, the price ceiling transfers the area of surplus (V) from producers to consumers. Note that the gain to consumers is less than the loss to producers, which is just another way of seeing the deadweight loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.21: Panel (a) shows the original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of 20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. Panel (b) shows the original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.21 (b) shows a price floor example using a string of struggling movie theaters, all in the same city. The current equilibrium is $8 per movie ticket, with 1,800 people attending movies. The original consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. The city government is worried that movie theaters will go out of business, reducing the entertainment options available to citizens, so it decides to impose a price floor of $12 per ticket. As a result, the quantity demanded of movie tickets falls to 1,400. The new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I. In effect, the price floor causes the area H to be transferred from consumer to producer surplus, but also causes a deadweight loss of J + K.\nThis analysis shows that a price ceiling, like a law establishing rent controls, will transfer some producer surplus to consumers—which helps to explain why consumers often favor them. Conversely, a price floor like a guarantee that farmers will receive a certain price for their crops will transfer some consumer surplus to producers, which explains why producers often favor them. However, both price floors and price ceilings block some transactions that buyers and sellers would have been willing to make, and creates deadweight loss. Removing such barriers, so that prices and quantities can adjust to their equilibrium level, will increase the economy’s social surplus.\n\n\n4.5.3 Demand and Supply as a Social Adjustment Mechanism\nThe demand and supply model emphasizes that prices are not set only by demand or only by supply, but by the interaction between the two. In 1890, the famous economist Alfred Marshall wrote that asking whether supply or demand determined a price was like arguing “whether it is the upper or the under blade of a pair of scissors that cuts a piece of paper.” The answer is that both blades of the demand and supply scissors are always involved.\nThe adjustments of equilibrium price and quantity in a market-oriented economy often occur without much government direction or oversight. If the coffee crop in Brazil suffers a terrible frost, then the supply curve of coffee shifts to the left and the price of coffee rises. Some people—call them the coffee addicts—continue to drink coffee and pay the higher price. Others switch to tea or soft drinks. No government commission is needed to figure out how to adjust coffee prices, which companies will be allowed to process the remaining supply, which supermarkets in which cities will get how much coffee to sell, or which consumers will ultimately be allowed to drink the brew. Such adjustments in response to price changes happen all the time in a market economy, often so smoothly and rapidly that we barely notice them.\nThink for a moment of all the seasonal foods that are available and inexpensive at certain times of the year, like fresh corn in midsummer, but more expensive at other times of the year. People alter their diets and restaurants alter their menus in response to these fluctuations in prices without fuss or fanfare. For both the U.S. economy and the world economy as a whole, markets—that is, demand and supply—are the primary social mechanism for answering the basic questions about what is produced, how it is produced, and for whom it is produced.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHY CAN WE NOT GET ENOUGH OF ORGANIC?\nOrganic food is grown without synthetic pesticides, chemical fertilizers or genetically modified seeds. In recent decades, the demand for organic products has increased dramatically. The Organic Trade Association reported sales increased from $1 billion in 1990 to $35.1 billion in 2013, more than 90% of which were sales of food products.\nWhy, then, are organic foods more expensive than their conventional counterparts? The answer is a clear application of the theories of supply and demand. As people have learned more about the harmful effects of chemical fertilizers, growth hormones, pesticides and the like from large-scale factory farming, our tastes and preferences for safer, organic foods have increased. This change in tastes has been reinforced by increases in income, which allow people to purchase pricier products, and has made organic foods more mainstream. This has led to an increased demand for organic foods. Graphically, the demand curve has shifted right, and we have moved up the supply curve as producers have responded to the higher prices by supplying a greater quantity.\nIn addition to the movement along the supply curve, we have also had an increase in the number of farmers converting to organic farming over time. This is represented by a shift to the right of the supply curve. Since both demand and supply have shifted to the right, the resulting equilibrium quantity of organic foods is definitely higher, but the price will only fall when the increase in supply is larger than the increase in demand. We may need more time before we see lower prices in organic foods. Since the production costs of these foods may remain higher than conventional farming, because organic fertilizers and pest management techniques are more expensive, they may never fully catch up with the lower prices of non-organic foods.\nAs a final, specific example: The Environmental Working Group’s “Dirty Dozen” list of fruits and vegetables, which test high for pesticide residue even after washing, was released in April 2013. The inclusion of strawberries on the list has led to an increase in demand for organic strawberries, resulting in both a higher equilibrium price and quantity of sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nConsumer surplus is the gap between the price that consumers are willing to pay, based on their preferences, and the market equilibrium price.\nProducer surplus is the gap between the price for which producers are willing to sell a product, based on their costs, and the market equilibrium price.\nSocial surplus is the sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus. Total surplus is larger at the equilibrium quantity and price than it will be at any other quantity and price.\nDeadweight loss is loss in total surplus that occurs when the economy produces at an inefficient quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes a price ceiling increase or decrease the number of transactions in a market? Why? What about a price floor?\nIf a price floor benefits producers, why does a price floor reduce social surplus?\nWhat is consumer surplus? How is it illustrated on a demand and supply diagram?\nWhat is producer surplus? How is it illustrated on a demand and supply diagram?\nWhat is total surplus? How is it illustrated on a demand and supply diagram?\nWhat is the relationship between total surplus and economic efficiency?\nWhat is deadweight loss?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The demand schedule shows that as price rises, quantity demanded decreases, and vice versa. These points are then graphed, and the line connecting them is the demand curve (D). The downward slope of the demand curve again illustrates the law of demand—the inverse relationship between prices and quantity demanded.\nFigure 4.2: Increased demand means that at every given price, the quantity demanded is higher, so that the demand curve shifts to the right from D0 to D1. Decreased demand means that at every given price, the quantity demanded is lower, so that the demand curve shifts to the left from D0 to D2.\nFigure 4.3: We can use the demand curve to identify how much consumers would buy at any given price.\nFigure 4.4: With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities, pushing demand to the right.\nFigure 4.5: With an increase in income, consumers will purchase larger quantities, pushing demand to the right, and causing the demand curve to shift right.\nFigure 4.6: Panel (a) shows a list of factors that can cause an increase in demand from D0 to D1. Panel (b) shows the same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in demand from D0 to D1.\nFigure 4.7: Decreased supply means that at every given price, the quantity supplied is lower, so that the supply curve shifts to the left, from S0 to S1. Increased supply means that at every given price, the quantity supplied is higher, so that the supply curve shifts to the right, from S0 to S2.\nFigure 4.8: You can use a supply curve to show the minimum price a firm will accept to produce a given quantity of output.\nFigure 4.9: The cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a product.\nFigure 4.10: Because the cost of production and the desired profit equal the price a firm will set for a product, if the cost of production increases, the price for the product will also need to increase.\nFigure 4.11: When the cost of production increases, the supply curve shifts upwardly to a new price level.\nFigure 4.12: Panel (a) shows a list of factors that can cause an increase in supply from S0 to S1. Panel (b) shows the same factors, if their direction is reversed, can cause a decrease in supply from S0 to S1.\nFigure 4.13: Unusually good weather leads to changes in the price and quantity of salmon.\nFigure 4.14: A change in tastes from print news sources to digital sources results in a leftward shift in demand for the former. The result is a decrease in both equilibrium price and quantity.\nFigure 4.15: Panel (a) shows higher labor compensation causes a leftward shift in the supply curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and an increase in the equilibrium price. Panel (b) shows a change in tastes away from Postal Services causes a leftward shift in the demand curve, a decrease in the equilibrium quantity, and a decrease in the equilibrium price.\nFigure 4.16: Supply and demand shifts cause changes in equilibrium price and quantity.\nFigure 4.17: A shift in one curve never causes a shift in the other curve. Rather, a shift in one curve causes a movement along the second curve.\nFigure 4.18: The original intersection of demand and supply occurs at E0. If demand shifts from D0 to D1, the new equilibrium would be at E1—unless a price ceiling prevents the price from rising. If the price is not permitted to rise, the quantity supplied remains at 15,000. However, after the change in demand, the quantity demanded rises to 19,000, resulting in a shortage.\nFigure 4.19: The intersection of demand (D) and supply (S) would be at the equilibrium point E0. However, a price floor set at Pf holds the price above E0 and prevents it from falling. The result of the price floor is that the quantity supplied Qs exceeds the quantity demanded Qd. There is excess supply, also called a surplus.\nFigure 4.20: The somewhat triangular area labeled by F shows the area of consumer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price in the market was less than what many of the consumers were willing to pay. Point J on the demand curve shows that, even at the price of $90, consumers would have been willing to purchase a quantity of 20 million. The somewhat triangular area labeled by G shows the area of producer surplus, which shows that the equilibrium price received in the market was more than what many of the producers were willing to accept for their products. For example, point K on the supply curve shows that at a price of $45, firms would have been willing to supply a quantity of 14 million.\nFigure 4.21: Panel (a) shows the original equilibrium price is $600 with a quantity of 20,000. Consumer surplus is T + U, and producer surplus is V + W + X. A price ceiling is imposed at $400, so firms in the market now produce only a quantity of 15,000. As a result, the new consumer surplus is T + V, while the new producer surplus is X. Panel (b) shows the original equilibrium is $8 at a quantity of 1,800. Consumer surplus is G + H + J, and producer surplus is I + K. A price floor is imposed at $12, which means that quantity demanded falls to 1,400. As a result, the new consumer surplus is G, and the new producer surplus is H + I.",

    "text": "5.1 Measuring the Size of the Economy: Gross Domestic Product\nMacroeconomics is an empirical subject, so the first step toward understanding it is to measure the economy. How large is the U.S. economy? The size of a nation’s overall economy is typically measured by its gross domestic product (GDP), which is the value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given year. The measurement of GDP involves counting up the production of millions of different goods and services—smart phones, cars, music downloads, computers, steel, bananas, college educations, and all other new goods and services produced in the current year—and summing them into a total dollar value.\nThis task is straightforward: take the quantity of everything produced, multiply it by the price at which each product sold, and add up the total. In 2021, the U.S. GDP totaled USD 24 trillion, the largest GDP in the world. Each of the market transactions that enter into GDP must involve both a buyer and a seller. The GDP of an economy can be measured either by the total dollar value of what is purchased in the economy, or by the total dollar value of what is produced. There is even a third way, as we will explain later.\nHow is GDP traditionally measured? There are three basic ways to determine a nation’s GDP.\nThe three methods of measuring GDP should result in the same number, with some possible difference caused by statistical and rounding differences. The credibility of data is always a significant concern in any form of research. An advantage of using the Expenditure Method is data integrity. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis considers the source data for expenditure components to be more reliable than for either income or production components.",

Add all of the expenditures together and you determine GDP.\nThe Production (Value Added) Approach\nThis method also called the Net Product or Value added method requires three stages of analysis. First gross value of output from all sectors is estimated. Then, intermediate consumption such as cost of materials, supplies and services used in production final output is derived. Then gross output is reduced by intermediate consumption to develop net production.\nThe Income Approach\nThis method of determining GDP is to add up all the income earned by households and firms in the year. The total expenditures on all of the final goods and services are also income received as wages, profits, rents, and interest income. By adding together all of the wages, profits, rents, and interest income, you determine GDP.\n\n\n\n5.1.1 GDP Measured by Components of Demand (Expenditure Approach)\nWho buys all of this production? This demand can be divided into four main parts: consumer spending (consumption), business spending (investment), government spending on goods and services, and spending on net exports. (See the note below to understand what is meant by investment.)\nIn the following table we print the current nominal GDP in Billion of current US Dollars.\n\n\nCode\ndf_sub = df_a[['GDP', 'Consumption', 'Investment', 'GovernmentSpending', \\\n              'Exports', 'Imports']]\ndf_sub.index = df_sub.index.strftime(\"%Y\")\npd.options.display.float_format = \"{:,.2f}\".format\n\nprint(np.round(df_sub.iloc[-2:].T, 1))\n\n\nyear                    2022      2023\nGDP                26,734.30 28,297.00\nConsumption        18,108.30 19,170.20\nInvestment          4,911.90  5,102.80\nGovernmentSpending  4,564.80  4,815.20\nExports             3,046.70  3,091.70\nImports             3,897.40  3,882.90\n\n\nThe following figures show how these four components added up to GDP in the past five years. The second figure below shows the components of GDP from the demand side.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,6))\nax.get_xaxis().set_visible(False)   # Hide Ticks\ndf_sub.iloc[-5:].plot(marker='o', ax=ax, fontsize=tickSize)\npd.plotting.table(ax, np.round(df_sub.iloc[-5:].T, 1), loc='bottom', fontsize=titleSize)\nax.set_title('Y = C + I + G + Ex - Im', fontsize=titleSize)\nax.set_ylabel('Billion current US$', fontsize=ylabelSize)\nax.legend(loc='right', bbox_to_anchor= (1.0, 0.4), fontsize=legendSize)\n#f_saveToPNG('Y_CIGNX_Fig11.png')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe next show the percentage decomposition for the latest year.\n\n\nCode\n# Print percent-composition of GDP in latest year\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\ndf_a['NetExports'] = df_a['Exports'] - df_a['Imports']\ndf_temp = df_a[['Consumption', 'Investment', 'GovernmentSpending', 'NetExports']].iloc[-2]/df_a['GDP'].iloc[-2]*100\ndf_temp.name = 'Year: ' + df_temp.name.strftime('%Y')\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,7))\ndf_temp.plot.bar(fontsize=14)\n\nax.set_title(\"Y = C + I + G + NX\", fontsize=18)\nax.set_ylabel(\"% of GDP\", fontsize=18);\n# create a list to collect the plt.patches data\ntotals = []\n\n# find the values and append to list\nfor i in ax.patches:\n    totals.append(i.get_height())\n\n# set individual bar lables using above list\ntotal = sum(totals)\n\n# set individual bar lables using above list\nfor i in ax.patches:\n    # get_x pulls left or right; get_height pushes up or down\n    ax.text(i.get_x()-.03, np.abs(i.get_height())+1.0, \\\n            str(round((i.get_height()/total)*100, 2))+'%', fontsize=15,\n                color='dimgrey')\n\nax.set_xticklabels([\"Consumption\", \"Investment\",\n                    \"Government Purchases\", \"Net Exports\"], rotation=0, fontsize=11)\nplt.axhline(y=0, xmin=0, xmax=2020, linewidth=2, linestyle='--', color='black')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe next show the same information in a pie chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS MEANT BY THE WORD “INVESTMENT”?\n\n\n\nWhat do economists mean by investment, or business spending? In calculating GDP, investment does not refer to the purchase of stocks and bonds or the trading of financial assets.\nIt refers to the purchase of new capital goods, that is, new commercial real estate (such as buildings, factories, and stores) and equipment, residential housing construction, and inventories.\nInventories that are produced this year are included in this year’s GDP—even if they have not yet sold. From the accountant’s perspective, it is as if the firm invested in its own inventories. Business investment in 2014 was almost $3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nNet investment equals gross investment minus depreciation. Depreciation refers to the devaluation of old investments that use value over time because of usage (wear and tear).\n\n\nFigure 5.2 Panel (a) shows the levels of consumption, investment, and government purchases over time, expressed as a percentage of GDP, while Figure 5.2 Panel (b) shows the levels of exports and imports as a percentage of GDP over time. A few patterns about each of these components are worth noticing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: GDP Components on the Demand Side\n\n\n\nPanel (a) Consumption is about two-thirds of GDP, but it moves relatively little over time. Business investment hovers around 15% of GDP, but it increases and declines more than consumption. Government spending on goods and services is around 20% of GDP.\nPanel (b) Exports are added to total demand for goods and services, while imports are subtracted from total demand. If exports exceed imports, as in most of the 1960s and 1970s in the U.S. economy, a trade surplus exists. If imports exceed exports, as in recent years, then a trade deficit exists. (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm)\nConsumption expenditure by households is the largest component of GDP, accounting for about two-thirds of the GDP in any year. This tells us that consumers’ spending decisions are a major driver of the economy. However, consumer spending is a gentle elephant: when viewed over time, it does not jump around too much.\nInvestment expenditure refers to purchases of physical plant and equipment, primarily by businesses. If Starbucks builds a new store, or Amazon buys robots, these expenditures are counted under business investment. Investment demand is far smaller than consumption demand, typically accounting for only about 15–18% of GDP, but it is very important for the economy because this is where jobs are created. However, it fluctuates more noticeably than consumption. Business investment is volatile; new technology or a new product can spur business investment, but then confidence can drop and business investment can pull back sharply.\nIf you have noticed any of the infrastructure projects (new bridges, highways, airports) launched during the recession of 2009, you have seen how important government spending can be for the economy. Government expenditure in the United States is about 20% of GDP, and includes spending by all three levels of government: federal, state, and local. The only part of government spending counted in demand is government purchases of goods or services produced in the economy. Examples include the government buying a new fighter jet for the Air Force (federal government spending), building a new highway (state government spending), or a new school (local government spending). A significant portion of government budgets are transfer payments, like unemployment benefits, veteran’s benefits, and Social Security payments to retirees. These payments are excluded from GDP because the government does not receive a new good or service in return or exchange. Instead they are transfers of income from taxpayers to others. If you are curious about the awesome undertaking of adding up GDP, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW DO STATISTICIANS MEASURE GDP?\nGovernment economists at the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), within the U.S. Department of Commerce, piece together estimates of GDP from a variety of sources.\nOnce every five years, in the second and seventh year of each decade, the Bureau of the Census carries out a detailed census of businesses throughout the United States. In between, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of retail sales. These figures are adjusted with foreign trade data to account for exports that are produced in the United States and sold abroad and for imports that are produced abroad and sold here. Once every ten years, the Census Bureau conducts a comprehensive survey of housing and residential finance. Together, these sources provide the main basis for figuring out what is produced for consumers.\nFor investment, the Census Bureau carries out a monthly survey of construction and an annual survey of expenditures on physical capital equipment.\nFor what is purchased by the federal government, the statisticians rely on the U.S. Department of the Treasury. An annual Census of Governments gathers information on state and local governments. Because a lot of government spending at all levels involves hiring people to provide services, a large portion of government spending is also tracked through payroll records collected by state governments and by the Social Security Administration.\nWith regard to foreign trade, the Census Bureau compiles a monthly record of all import and export documents. Additional surveys cover transportation and travel, and adjustment is made for financial services that are produced in the United States for foreign customers.\nMany other sources contribute to the estimates of GDP. Information on energy comes from the U.S. Department of Transportation and Department of Energy. Information on healthcare is collected by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality. Surveys of landlords find out about rental income. The Department of Agriculture collects statistics on farming.\nAll of these bits and pieces of information arrive in different forms, at different time intervals. The BEA melds them together to produce estimates of GDP on a quarterly basis (every three months). These numbers are then “annualized” by multiplying by four. As more information comes in, these estimates are updated and revised. The “advance” estimate of GDP for a certain quarter is released one month after a quarter. The “preliminary” estimate comes out one month after that. The “final” estimate is published one month later, but it is not actually final. In July, roughly updated estimates for the previous calendar year are released. Then, once every five years, after the results of the latest detailed five-year business census have been processed, the BEA revises all of the past estimates of GDP according to the newest methods and data, going all the way back to 1929.\n\n\nWhen thinking about the demand for domestically produced goods in a global economy, it is important to count spending on exports—domestically produced goods that are sold abroad. By the same token, we must also subtract spending on imports—goods produced in other countries that are purchased by residents of this country. The net export component of GDP is equal to the dollar value of exports (X) minus the dollar value of imports (M), (X – M). The gap between exports and imports is called the trade balance. If a country’s exports are larger than its imports, then a country is said to have a trade surplus. In the United States, exports typically exceeded imports in the 1960s and 1970s, as shown in Figure (b).\nSince the early 1980s, imports have typically exceeded exports, and so the United States has experienced a trade deficit in most years. Indeed, the trade deficit grew quite large in the late 1990s and in the mid-2000s. Figure (b) also shows that imports and exports have both risen substantially in recent decades, even after the declines during the Great Recession between 2008 and 2009.\n\nVideo - Measuring GDP with the Expenditure Approach\n\n    \n\n\nAs noted before, if exports and imports are equal, foreign trade has no effect on total GDP. However, even if exports and imports are balanced overall, foreign trade might still have powerful effects on particular industries and workers by causing nations to shift workers and physical capital investment toward one industry rather than another.\nBased on these four components of demand, GDP can be measured as:\n\\[GDP = Consumption + Investment + Government + Trade Balance\\]\n\\[GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)\\]\n\nC = Personal Consumption Expenditures\nI = Gross Private Fixed Investment\nG = Government Expenditures and Investment\nX = Exports\nM = Imports\n\nUnderstanding how to measure GDP is important for analyzing connections in the macro economy and for thinking about macroeconomic policy tools.\nThe Expenditure Approach is the most commonly discussed method of representing GDP particularly in non-academic examinations of economic activity.\n\n\n5.1.2 GDP Measured by What is Produced (Value Added Approach)\nEverything that is purchased must be produced first. Table 5.1 breaks down what is produced into five categories: durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and the change in inventories. Before going into detail about these categories, notice that total GDP measured according to what is produced is exactly the same as the GDP measured by looking at the five components of demand.\n\n\n\nTable 5.1: Components of U.S. GDP on the Production Side, 2016 (Source: http://bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm)\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent of GDP\nTrillions of $\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nDurable goods\n$3.0\n16.1%\n\n\nNondurable goods\n$2.5\n13.4%\n\n\nServices\n$11.6\n62.4%\n\n\nStructures\n$1.5\n8.1%\n\n\nChange in inventories\n$0.0\n0.0%\n\n\nTotal GDP\n$18.6\n100%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nServices make up over half of the production side components of GDP in the United States.\n\n\nSince every market transaction must have both a buyer and a seller, GDP must be the same whether measured by what is demanded or by what is produced. Figure 5.3 shows these components of what is produced, expressed as a percentage of GDP, since 1960.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Services are the largest single component of total supply, representing over half of GDP. Nondurable goods used to be larger than durable goods, but in recent years, nondurable goods have been dropping closer to durable goods, which is about 20% of GDP. Structures hover around 10% of GDP. The change in inventories, the final component of aggregate supply, is not shown here; it is typically less than 1% of GDP.\n\n\n\nIn thinking about what is produced in the economy, many non-economists immediately focus on solid, long-lasting goods, like cars and computers. By far the largest part of GDP, however, is services. Moreover, services have been a growing share of GDP over time. A detailed breakdown of the leading service industries would include healthcare, education, and legal and financial services. It has been decades since most of the U.S. economy involved making solid objects. Instead, the most common jobs in a modern economy involve a worker looking at pieces of paper or a computer screen; meeting with co-workers, customers, or suppliers; or making phone calls.\nEven within the overall category of goods, long-lasting durable goods like cars and refrigerators are about the same share of the economy as short-lived nondurable goods like food and clothing. The category of structures includes everything from homes, to office buildings, shopping malls, and factories. Inventories is a small category that refers to the goods that have been produced by one business but have not yet been sold to consumers, and are still sitting in warehouses and on shelves. The amount of inventories sitting on shelves tends to decline if business is better than expected, or to rise if business is worse than expected.\n\n\n5.1.3 GDP Measured by the Generated Income (Income Approach)\nBefore moving forward in our discussion, it should be noted, the income approach is gathering a growing following. This is true particularly among economic blogs, investment publications and cable news business programs due to its concentration on the importance of wages.\nAn alternative method of calculating GNP using the Income Approach is “RIPSAW.”\nThe mnemonic “RIPSAW” breaks down as follows:\n\\[GDP = R + I + P + S + A + W\\]\n\nR = rents\nI = interests\nP = profits\nSA = statistical adjustments (corporate income taxes, dividends, undistributed corporate profits\nW = wages\n\n\n\n5.1.4 The Problem of Double Counting\nGDP is defined as the current value of all final goods and services produced in a nation in a year. What are final goods? They are goods at the furthest stage of production at the end of a year. Statisticians who calculate GDP must avoid the mistake of double counting, in which output is counted more than once as it travels through the stages of production. For example, imagine what would happen if government statisticians first counted the value of tires produced by a tire manufacturer, and then counted the value of a new truck sold by an automaker that contains those tires. In this example, the value of the tires would have been counted twice-because the price of the truck includes the value of the tires.\nTo avoid this problem, which would overstate the size of the economy considerably, government statisticians count just the value of final goods and services in the chain of production that are sold for consumption, investment, government, and trade purposes. Intermediate goods, which are goods that go into the production of other goods, are excluded from GDP calculations. From the example above, only the value of the Ford truck will be counted. The value of what businesses provide to other businesses is captured in the final products at the end of the production chain.\nThe concept of GDP is fairly straightforward: it is just the dollar value of all final goods and services produced in the economy in a year. In our decentralized, market-oriented economy, actually calculating the more than $24 trillion-dollar U.S. GDP—along with how it is changing every few months—is a full-time job for a brigade of government statisticians.\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Counting GDP\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Counted in GDP\nWhat is not included in GDP\n\n\n\n\nConsumption\nIntermediate goods\n\n\nBusiness investment\nTransfer payments and non-market activities\n\n\nGovernment spending on goods and services\nUsed goods\n\n\nNet exports\nIllegal goods Household production\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice the items that are not counted into GDP, as outlined in Table 5.2. The sales of used goods are not included because they were produced in a previous year and are part of that year’s GDP. The entire underground economy of services paid “under the table” and illegal sales should be counted, but is not, because it is impossible to track these sales.\nIn a recent study by Friedrich Schneider of shadow economies, the underground economy in the United States was estimated to be 6.6% of GDP, or close to $2 trillion dollars in 2013 alone.\nTransfer payments, such as payment by the government to individuals (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Unemployment benefits), are not included, because they do not represent production.\nAlso, production of some goods—such as home production as when you make your breakfast—is not counted because these goods are not sold in the marketplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHome Production\nIf a dad takes care of his baby, these services are not included in GDP as it falls under home production. If the same family hires a babysitter that they pay officially for care services, then the value of these services is counted towards GDP.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.5 Other Ways to Measure the Economy\nBesides GDP, there are several different but closely related ways of measuring the size of the economy. We mentioned above that GDP can be thought of as total production and as total purchases. It can also be thought of as total income since anything produced and sold produces income.\nOne of the closest cousins of GDP is the gross national product (GNP). GDP includes only what is produced within a country’s borders. GNP adds what is produced by domestic businesses and labor abroad, and subtracts out any payments sent home to other countries by foreign labor and businesses located in the United States.\nIn other words, GNP is based more on the production of citizens and firms of a country, wherever they are located, and GDP is based on what happens within the geographic boundaries of a certain country. For the United States, the gap between GDP and GNP is relatively small; in recent years, only about 0.2%. For small nations, which may have a substantial share of their population working abroad and sending money back home, the difference can be substantial.\nNet national product (NNP) is calculated by taking GNP and then subtracting the value of how much physical capital is worn out, or reduced in value because of aging, over the course of a year. The process by which capital ages and loses value is called depreciation. The NNP can be further subdivided into national income, which includes all income to businesses and individuals, and personal income, which includes only income to people.\n\nGNP = GDP + net factor payments (roughly: subtract income of foreign firms operating in US and add income of US firms operating in foreign countries)\nNNP = GNP - capital depreciation\nNational income = NNP - indirect taxes, where indirect taxes are sales taxes or excise taxes on products.\n\nFor practical purposes, it is not vital to memorize these definitions. However, it is important to be aware that these differences exist and to know what statistic you are looking at, so that you do not accidentally compare, say, GDP in one year or for one country with GNP or NNP in another year or another country. To get an idea of how these calculations work, follow the steps in the following example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToDo\n\n\n\nCALCULATING GDP, NET EXPORTS, AND NNP\nBased on the information in Table 5.3:\n\nWhat is the value of GDP?\nWhat is the value of net exports?\nWhat is the value of NNP?\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.3: Example Table\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nAmount\n\n\n\n\nGovernment purchases\n$120 billion\n\n\nDepreciation\n$40 billion\n\n\nConsumption\n$400 billion\n\n\nBusiness Investment\n$60 billion\n\n\nExports\n$100 billion\n\n\nImports\n$120 billion\n\n\nIncome receipts from rest of the world\n$10 billion\n\n\nIncome payments to rest of the world\n$8 billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer (a): To calculate GDP use the following formula:\nGDP = Consumption + Investment + Governmentspending + (Exports – Imports)\nor shorter:\n\\[Y = C + I + G + (X – M)\\]\nUsing the numbers from Table 5.3 we get:\n\\[Y = $400 + $60 + $120 + ($100 – $120) = $560\\ billion\\]\nAnswer (b): To calculate net exports, subtract imports from exports.\n\\[\\text{Net exports} = X – M = $100 – $120 = –$20\\ billion\\]\nAnswer (c): To calculate NNP, use the following formula:\nNNP =   GDP\n      + Income receipts from the rest of the world\n      – Income payments to the rest of the world\n      – Depreciation\n\\[\\text{NNP} = $560 + $10 – $8 – $40 = $522\\ billion\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\nThe size of a nation’s economy is commonly expressed as its gross domestic product (GDP), which measures the value of the output of all goods and services produced within the country in a year. GDP is measured by taking the quantities of all goods and services produced, multiplying them by their prices, and summing the total. Since GDP measures what is bought and sold in the economy, it can be measured either by the sum of what is purchased in the economy or what is produced.\nDemand can be divided into consumption, investment, government, exports, and imports. What is produced in the economy can be divided into durable goods, nondurable goods, services, structures, and inventories. To avoid double counting, GDP counts only final output of goods and services, not the production of intermediate goods or the value of labor in the chain of production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich of the following are included in GDP, and which are not?\n\n\nThe cost of hospital stays\nThe rise in life expectancy over time\nChild care provided by a licensed day care center\nChild care provided by a grandmother\nThe sale of a used car\nThe sale of a new car\nThe greater variety of cheese available in supermarkets\nThe iron that goes into the steel that goes into a refrigerator bought by a consumer.\n\n\nWhat are the main components of measuring GDP with what is demanded?",

    "text": "5.2 Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nContrast nominal GDP and real GDP\nExplain GDP deflator\nCalculate real GDP based on nominal GDP values\n\n\n\nWhen examining economic statistics, there is a crucial distinction worth emphasizing. The distinction is between nominal and real measurements, which refer to whether or not inflation has distorted a given statistic. Looking at economic statistics without considering inflation is like looking through a pair of binoculars and trying to guess how close something is: unless you know how strong the lenses are, you cannot guess the distance very accurately. Similarly, if you do not know the rate of inflation, it is difficult to figure out if a rise in GDP is due mainly to a rise in the overall level of prices or to a rise in quantities of goods produced. The nominal value of any economic statistic means the statistic is measured in terms of actual prices that exist at the time. The real value refers to the same statistic after it has been adjusted for inflation. Generally, it is the real value that is more important.\n\n5.2.1 Calculating Nominal GDP and calculating Real GDP\nImagine a simple economy where three final consumption goods and services are produced, Automobiles, computers, and haircuts, in year 2018.\n\n\n\n2018\nCurrent Price\nQuantity\nNominal Value\n\n\n\n\nAutomobiles\n$5,000\n2,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\nComputers\n$1,000\n10,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\nHaircuts\n$10\n1,000,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\n\nYou can calculate nominal GDP for year 2014 by simply adding up the total value of all three product categories, which results in a nominal GDP of $30 million.\nNow let's have a look at the next year, 2019. For 2019 some of the prices will change as will the quantities produced. Below you will have a detailed breakdown of the changes.\n\n\n\n2019\nCurrent Price\nQuantity\nNominal Value\n\n\n\n\nAutomobiles\n$10,000\n1,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\nComputers\n$2,000\n5,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\nHaircuts\n$20\n500,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\n\nIf we were to calculate nominal GDP for year 2019 we would again find that GDP is $30 million. The economy, in terms of nominal GDP, is of equal size. It produces the same value of final goods and services than in the previous year.\nThe growth rate \\(g\\) of nominal GDP between 2018 and 2019 is\n\\[g = \\frac{$30mill - $30mill}{$30mill} \\times 100= 0 \\%.\\]\nNow have a careful look at the tables. Nominal GDP says there was no change in terms of economic activity. In other words the economy did not grow or shrink in size. Have a careful look at the tables. Is this accurate? It seems that the economy in 2019 produces only half of all the goods and services that it produced in 2018. Less 'stuff' is made. However, the prices have increased. So if you multiply price with quantity, you do not see the \"real\" change of an actual decline in the quantity of goods and services that are now available for production. Nominal GDP is not a good measure to compare economic activity over time as you can clear see from this example. So how can we do better?\nHow about we evaluate the dollar value of final goods and services in the two years with the VERY SAME PRICES? Pick say, the prices from year 2018, and calculate GDP in both years with these prices. If you do this, you get the following GDP figures (these is now referred to as real GDP).\n\n\n\n2018\nCurrent Price\nQuantity\nReal Value\n\n\n\n\nAutomobiles\n$5,000\n2,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\nComputers\n$1,000\n10,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\nHaircuts\n$10\n1,000,000\n$10,000,000\n\n\n\nReal GDP for 2018 is again $30 million. This is an important fact. By definition, in the base year (and we said above that we treat 2018 as our base year) nominal GDP is the same as real GDP.\nWhen setting up the table for 2019 we now use the same prices from 2018. We call 2018 the BASE YEAR.\n\n\n\n2019\nPrice 2018\nQuantity\nReal Value\n\n\n\n\nAutomobiles\n$5,000\n1,000\n$5,000,000\n\n\nComputers\n$1,000\n5,000\n$5,000,000\n\n\nHaircuts\n$10\n500,000\n$5,000,000\n\n\n\n\nVideo - Nominal vs. Real GDP\n\n    \n\n\nReal GDP in 2019 is $15 million. We now clearly see that the economy shrank by half. When calculating real GDP we basically ignore the price effects. The growth rate \\(g\\) of real GDP between 2018 and 2019 is\n\\[g = \\frac{$15mill - $30mill}{$30mill} \\times 100= -200 \\%.\\]\nHave a look at the following video for another example of nominal vs. real GDP.\nThe GDP deflator is the ratio of nominal to real GDP.\n\\[\\text{GDP-Deflator}=100 \\times \\frac{\\text{Nominal-GDP in year t}}{\\text{Real-GDP in year t}}\\]\nThe GDP deflator is a price index that indicates the magnitude of economy wide prices changes of all final goods and services. It is not a percentage. In our example the GDP-Deflator is\n\\[\\text{GDP-Deflator-2019}=100 \\times \\frac{$30 mill}{$15 mill} = 200\\]\nIn a later chapter you will learn that one measure of price inflation is the rate of change in price indices. The GDP deflator is one such index. The consumer price index (CPI) is another price index. We will discuss the CPI later.\nIf we were to calculate inflation using the GDP deflator in this example we need to calculate the GDP-deflator for 2018 and the GDP-deflator for 2019 and then calculate the rate of change (or growth rate) of the GDP deflator.\n\\[\\text{GDP-Deflator-2018}=100 \\times \\frac{\\text{Nominal-GDP in 2018}}{\\text{Real-GDP in 2018}} = 100 \\times \\frac{$30 mill}{$30 mill} = 100\\]\n\\[\\text{GDP-Deflator-2019}=100 \\times \\frac{\\text{Nominal-GDP in 2019}}{\\text{Real-GDP in 2019}} = 100 \\times \\frac{$30 mill}{$15 mill} = 200\\]\nIt is important to keep in mind that we used 2018 as the BASE YEAR. You then see that the CPI in the base year is by definition equal to 100. In the base year nominal GDP and real GDP are the same! The ratio of the two is then obviously equal to one.\nWe now calculate the rate of change in the GDP-deflator, which is our price index, in order to get a measure for inflation\n\\[\\text{Inflation-GDP-Deflator-2019}= \\frac{200 - 100}{100} \\times 100 = 100 \\%.\\]\n\n\n5.2.2 Converting Nominal to Real GDP\nThe following Table shows U.S. GDP at five-year intervals since 1960 in nominal dollars; that is, GDP measured using the actual market prices prevailing in each stated year.\n\n\nCode\n# GDP Deflator\ndf_a['GDP_Deflator'] = df_a['GDP']/df_a['rGDP']*100\ndf1_a = df_a[['GDP', 'GDP_Deflator']].copy()\n\nprint(df1_a.loc['1960'::])\n\n\n                 GDP  GDP_Deflator\nyear                              \n1960-01-01    540.20         15.57\n1961-01-01    580.61         15.72\n1962-01-01    612.28         15.90\n1963-01-01    653.94         16.15\n1964-01-01    697.32         16.37\n...              ...           ...\n2019-01-01 21,933.22        104.52\n2020-01-01 22,068.77        106.24\n2021-01-01 24,777.04        112.83\n2022-01-01 26,734.28        120.16\n2023-01-01 28,296.97        123.24\n\n[64 rows x 2 columns]\n\n\nThis information is also reflected in the next graph.\n\n\nCode\ndf_a[['GDP']].loc['1960'::].plot(style = ['-'])\nplt.title('Nominal GDP', fontsize=titleSize)\nplt.ylabel('in Billion US $')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf an unwary analyst compared nominal GDP in 1960 to nominal GDP in 2010, it might appear that national output had risen by a factor of twenty-seven over this time (that is, GDP of $14,958 billion in 2010 divided by GDP of $543 billion in 1960).\nThis conclusion would be highly misleading. Recall that nominal GDP is defined as the quantity of every good or service produced multiplied by the price at which it was sold, summed up for all goods and services. In order to see how much production has actually increased, we need to extract the effects of higher prices on nominal GDP. This can be easily done, using the GDP deflator.\nGDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy. We explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in Inflation, but this definition will do in the context of this chapter. The data for the GDP deflator are given in the table above and are shown graphically in the following figure.\n\n\nCode\ndf_a[['GDP_Deflator']].loc['1960'::].plot(style = ['-'])\nplt.title('GDP-Deflator', fontsize=titleSize)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure shows that the price level has risen dramatically since 1960. The price level in 2010 was almost six times higher than in 1960 (the deflator for 2010 was 110 versus a level of 19 in 1960). Clearly, much of the apparent growth in nominal GDP was due to inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and services produced, in other words, not in real GDP. Recall that nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in output, and/or an increase in prices.\nWhat is needed is to extract the increase in prices from nominal GDP so as to measure only changes in output. After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth more than the inflated dollars of 1990—and the price index tells exactly how much more. This adjustment is easy to do if you understand that nominal measurements are in value terms, where\n\\[Value = Price \\times Quantity\\]\nor\n\\[Nominal\\ GDP = GDP\\ Deflator \\times Real\\ GDP\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMicro Example\nLet’s look at an example at the micro level. Suppose the t-shirt company, Coolshirts, sells 10 t-shirts at a price of $9 each.\n\\[nominal\\ revenue\\ from\\ sale = Price \\times Quantity\n= $9 \\times 10\n= $90\\]\nThen Coolshirts real income is:\n\\[real\\ income = \\frac{Nominal\\ revenue}{Price} \\] \\[ = \\frac{$90}{$9} = 10\\]\nIn other words, when we compute “real” measurements we are trying to get at actual quantities, in this case, 10 t-shirts.\n\n\nWith GDP, it is just a tiny bit more complicated. We start with the same formula as above:\n\\[Real\\ GDP = \\frac{Nominal\\ GDP}{Price\\ Index}\\]\nFor reasons that will be explained in more detail below, mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal number like 1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with decimals, when the price index is published, it has traditionally been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125. What this means is that when we “deflate” nominal figures to get real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price index). We also need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make the math work.\nSo the formula becomes:\n\\[Real\\ GDP = \\frac{Nominal\\ GDP}{Price\\ Index /100}\n= \\frac{Nominal\\ GDP}{Price\\ Index} \\times 100\\]\nThe following figure plots nominal and real US-GDP with 2012 as base year. This is the reason why the two lines cross in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nReal and Nominal GDP in Base Year\nBy definition, in the base year real GDP is the same as nominal GDP.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_q[['GDP', 'rGDP']].plot(style = ['-', '--'])\nplt.title('Nominal and Real US-GDP (2012 Base Year)' , fontsize=titleSize)\nplt.ylabel('in Billion US $')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\nThe nominal value of an economic statistic is the commonly announced value. The real value is the value after adjusting for changes in inflation. To convert nominal economic data from several different years into real, inflation-adjusted data, the starting point is to choose a base year arbitrarily and then use a price index to convert the measurements so that they are measured in the money prevailing in the base year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the difference between a series of economic data over time measured in nominal terms versus the same data series over time measured in real terms?\nHow do you convert a series of nominal economic data over time to real terms?",

By convention, GDP growth is reported at an annualized rate: Whatever the calculated growth in real GDP was for the quarter, it is multiplied by four when it is reported as if the economy were growing at that rate for a full year.\nThe following figure shows the pattern of U.S. real GDP since 1900.\n\n\nCode\ndf_q['rGDP'].plot(style = ['-'])\nplt.title('Real US-GDP (2012 Base Year)' , fontsize=titleSize)\nplt.ylabel('in Billion US $')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe generally upward long-term path of GDP has been regularly interrupted by short-term declines. A significant decline in real GDP is called a recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRecession\nA recession is commonly defined as six consecutive months of declining real GDP.\n\n\nAn especially lengthy and deep recession is called a depression. The severe drop in GDP that occurred during the Great Depression of the 1930s is clearly visible in the figure, as is the Great Recession of 2008–2009.\nReal GDP is important because it is highly correlated with other measures of economic activity, like employment and unemployment. When real GDP rises, so does employment.\nThe most significant human problem associated with recessions (and their larger, uglier cousins, depressions) is that a slowdown in production means that firms need to lay off or fire some of the workers they have. Losing a job imposes painful financial and personal costs on workers, and often on their extended families as well. In addition, even those who keep their jobs are likely to find that wage raises are scanty at best—or they may even be asked to take pay cuts.\nTable 5.4 lists the pattern of recessions and expansions in the U.S. economy since 1900. The highest point of the economy, before the recession begins, is called the peak; conversely, the lowest point of a recession, before a recovery begins, is called the trough. Thus, a recession lasts from peak to trough, and an economic upswing runs from trough to peak. The movement of the economy from peak to trough and trough to peak is called the business cycle. It is intriguing to notice that the three longest trough-to-peak expansions of the twentieth century have happened since 1960. The most recent recession started in December 2007 and ended formally in June 2009. This was the most severe recession since the Great Depression of the 1930’s.\n\n\n\nTable 5.4: U.S. Business Cycles since 1900 (Source: http://www.nber.org/cycles/main.html)\n\n\n\n\n\nTrough\nPeak\nMonths of Contraction\nMonths of Expansion\n\n\n\n\nDecember 1900\nSeptember 1902\n18\n21\n\n\nAugust 1904\nMay 1907\n23\n33\n\n\nJune 1908\nJanuary 1910\n13\n19\n\n\nJanuary 1912\nJanuary 1913\n24\n12\n\n\nDecember 1914\nAugust 1918\n23\n44\n\n\nMarch 1919\nJanuary 1920\n7\n10\n\n\nJuly 1921\nMay 1923\n18\n22\n\n\nJuly 1924\nOctober 1926\n14\n27\n\n\nNovember 1927\nAugust 1929\n23\n21\n\n\nMarch 1933\nMay 1937\n43\n50\n\n\nJune 1938\nFebruary 1945\n13\n80\n\n\nOctober 1945\nNovember 1948\n8\n37\n\n\nOctober 1949\nJuly 1953\n11\n45\n\n\nMay 1954\nAugust 1957\n10\n39\n\n\nApril 1958\nApril 1960\n8\n24\n\n\nFebruary 1961\nDecember 1969\n10\n106\n\n\nNovember 1970\nNovember 1973\n11\n36\n\n\nMarch 1975\nJanuary 1980\n16\n58\n\n\nJuly 1980\nJuly 1981\n6\n12\n\n\nNovember 1982\nJuly 1990\n16\n92\n\n\nMarch 2001\nNovember 2001\n8\n120\n\n\nDecember 2007\nJune 2009\n18\n73\n\n\nFebruary 2020\nApril 2020\n2\n128\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA private think tank, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), is the official tracker of business cycles for the U.S. economy.

    "section": "5.4 Comparing GDP among Countries",
    "text": "5.4 Comparing GDP among Countries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain how GDP can be used to compare the economic welfare of different nations\nCalculate the conversion of GDP to a common currency by using exchange rates\nCalculate GDP per capita using population data\n\n\n\nIt is common to use GDP as a measure of economic welfare or standard of living in a nation. When comparing the GDP of different nations for this purpose, two issues immediately arise. First, the GDP of a country is measured in its own currency: the United States uses the U.S. dollar; Canada, the Canadian dollar; most countries of Western Europe, the euro; Japan, the yen; Mexico, the peso; and so on. Thus, comparing GDP between two countries requires converting to a common currency. A second issue is that countries have very different numbers of people. For instance, the United States has a much larger economy than Mexico or Canada, but it also has roughly three times as many people as Mexico and nine times as many people as Canada. So, if we are trying to compare standards of living across countries, we need to divide GDP by population.\n\n5.4.1 Converting Currencies with Exchange Rates\nTo compare the GDP of countries with different currencies, it is necessary to convert to a “common denominator” using an exchange rate, which is the value of one currency in terms of another currency. Exchange rates are expressed either as the units of country A’s currency that need to be traded for a single unit of country B’s currency (for example, Japanese yen per British pound), or as the inverse (for example, British pounds per Japanese yen).\nTwo types of exchange rates can be used for this purpose, market exchange rates and purchasing power parity (PPP) equivalent exchange rates. Market exchange rates vary on a day-to-day basis depending on supply and demand in foreign exchange markets. PPP-equivalent exchange rates provide a longer run measure of the exchange rate. For this reason, PPP-equivalent exchange rates are typically used for cross country comparisons of GDP.\n\n\n5.4.2 GDP Per Capita\nThe U.S. economy has the largest GDP in the world, by a considerable amount. The United States is also a populous country; in fact, it is the third largest country by population in the world, although well behind China and India. So is the U.S. economy larger than other countries just because the United States has more people than most other countries, or because the U.S. economy is actually larger on a per-person basis? This question can be answered by calculating a country’s GDP per capita; that is, the GDP divided by the population.\nGDP per capita = GDP/population GDP per capita = GDP/population\nThe second column of Table lists the GDP of the same selection of countries that appeared in the previous Tracking Real GDP over Time and Table, showing their GDP as converted into U.S. dollars (which is the same as the last column of the previous table). The third column gives the population for each country. The fourth column lists the GDP per capita. GDP per capita is obtained in two steps: First, by dividing column two (GDP, in billions of dollars) by 1000 so it has the same units as column three (Population, in millions).

    "text": "5.5 How Well GDP Measures the Well-Being of Society\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss how productivity influences the standard of living\nExplain the limitations of GDP as a measure of the standard of living\nAnalyze the relationship between GDP data and fluctuations in the standard of living\n\n\n\nThe level of GDP per capita clearly captures some of what we mean by the phrase “standard of living.” Most of the migration in the world, for example, involves people who are moving from countries with relatively low GDP per capita to countries with relatively high GDP per capita.\n“Standard of living” is a broader term than GDP. While GDP focuses on production that is bought and sold in markets, standard of living includes all elements that affect people’s well-being, whether they are bought and sold in the market or not. To illuminate the gap between GDP and standard of living, it is useful to spell out some things that GDP does not cover that are clearly relevant to standard of living.\n\n5.5.1 Limitations of GDP as a Measure of the Standard of Living\nWhile GDP includes spending on recreation and travel, it does not cover leisure time. Clearly, however, there is a substantial difference between an economy that is large because people work long hours, and an economy that is just as large because people are more productive with their time so they do not have to work as many hours. The GDP per capita of the U.S. economy is larger than the GDP per capita of Germany, as was shown in [link], but does that prove that the standard of living in the United States is higher? Not necessarily, since it is also true that the average U.S. worker works several hundred hours more per year more than the average German worker. The calculation of GDP does not take the German worker’s extra weeks of vacation into account.\nWhile GDP includes what is spent on environmental protection, healthcare, and education, it does not include actual levels of environmental cleanliness, health, and learning. GDP includes the cost of buying pollution-control equipment, but it does not address whether the air and water are actually cleaner or dirtier. GDP includes spending on medical care, but does not address whether life expectancy or infant mortality have risen or fallen. Similarly, it counts spending on education, but does not address directly how much of the population can read, write, or do basic mathematics.\nGDP includes production that is exchanged in the market, but it does not cover production that is not exchanged in the market. For example, hiring someone to mow your lawn or clean your house is part of GDP, but doing these tasks yourself is not part of GDP. One remarkable change in the U.S. economy in recent decades is that, as of 1970, only about 42% of women participated in the paid labor force. By the second decade of the 2000s, nearly 60% of women participated in the paid labor force according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. As women are now in the labor force, many of the services they used to produce in the non-market economy like food preparation and child care have shifted to some extent into the market economy, which makes the GDP appear larger even if more services are not actually being consumed.\nGDP has nothing to say about the level of inequality in society. GDP per capita is only an average. When GDP per capita rises by 5%, it could mean that GDP for everyone in the society has risen by 5%, or that of some groups has risen by more while that of others has risen by less—or even declined. GDP also has nothing in particular to say about the amount of variety available. If a family buys 100 loaves of bread in a year, GDP does not care whether they are all white bread, or whether the family can choose from wheat, rye, pumpernickel, and many others—it just looks at whether the total amount spent on bread is the same.\nLikewise, GDP has nothing much to say about what technology and products are available. The standard of living in, for example, 1950 or 1900 was not affected only by how much money people had—it was also affected by what they could buy. No matter how much money you had in 1950, you could not buy an iPhone or a personal computer.\nIn certain cases, it is not clear that a rise in GDP is even a good thing. If a city is wrecked by a hurricane, and then experiences a surge of rebuilding construction activity, it would be peculiar to claim that the hurricane was therefore economically beneficial. If people are led by a rising fear of crime, to pay for installation of bars and burglar alarms on all their windows, it is hard to believe that this increase in GDP has made them better off. In that same vein, some people would argue that sales of certain goods, like pornography or extremely violent movies, do not represent a gain to society’s standard of living.\n\n\n5.5.2 Does a Rise in GDP Overstate or Understate the Rise in the Standard of Living?\nThe fact that GDP per capita does not fully capture the broader idea of standard of living has led to a concern that the increases in GDP over time are illusory. It is theoretically possible that while GDP is rising, the standard of living could be falling if human health, environmental cleanliness, and other factors that are not included in GDP are worsening. Fortunately, this fear appears to be overstated.\nIn some ways, the rise in GDP understates the actual rise in the standard of living. For example, the typical workweek for a U.S. worker has fallen over the last century from about 60 hours per week to less than 40 hours per week. Life expectancy and health have risen dramatically, and so has the average level of education. Since 1970, the air and water in the United States have generally been getting cleaner. New technologies have been developed for entertainment, travel, information, and health. A much wider variety of basic products like food and clothing is available today than several decades ago. Because GDP does not capture leisure, health, a cleaner environment, the possibilities created by new technology, or an increase in variety, the actual rise in the standard of living for Americans in recent decades has exceeded the rise in GDP.\nOn the other side, rates of crime, levels of traffic congestion, and inequality of incomes are higher in the United States now than they were in the 1960s. Moreover, a substantial number of services that used to be provided, primarily by women, in the non-market economy are now part of the market economy that is counted by GDP. By ignoring these factors, GDP would tend to overstate the true rise in the standard of living.\n\n\n5.5.3 GDP is Rough, but Useful\nA high level of GDP should not be the only goal of macroeconomic policy, or government policy more broadly. Even though GDP does not measure the broader standard of living with any precision, it does measure production well and it does indicate when a country is materially better or worse off in terms of jobs and incomes. In most countries, a significantly higher GDP per capita occurs hand in hand with other improvements in everyday life along many dimensions, like education, health, and environmental protection.\nNo single number can capture all the elements of a term as broad as “standard of living.” Nonetheless, GDP per capita is a reasonable, rough-and-ready measure of the standard of living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHOW IS THE ECONOMY DOING? HOW DOES ONE TELL?\n\n\n\nTo determine the state of the economy, one needs to examine economic indicators, such as GDP. To calculate GDP is quite an undertaking. It is the broadest measure of a nation’s economic activity and we owe a debt to Simon Kuznets, the creator of the measurement, for that. The sheer size of the U.S. economy as measured by GDP is huge—as of the third quarter of 2013, $16.6 trillion worth of goods and services were produced annually. Real GDP informed us that the recession of 2008–2009 was a severe one and that the recovery from that has been slow, but is improving.\nGDP per capita gives a rough estimate of a nation’s standard of living. This chapter is the building block for other chapters that explore more economic indicators such as unemployment, inflation, or interest rates, and perhaps more importantly, will explain how they are related and what causes them to rise or fall.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nGDP is an indicator of a society’s standard of living, but it is only a rough indicator.\nGDP does not directly take account of leisure, environmental quality, levels of health and education, activities conducted outside the market, changes in inequality of income, increases in variety, increases in technology, or the (positive or negative) value that society may place on certain types of output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList some of the reasons why GDP should not be considered an effective measure of the standard of living in a country.\nHow might a “green” GDP be measured?",

    "text": "6.1 Introduction\nWe live in a global marketplace. The food on your table might include fresh fruit from Chile, cheese from France, and bottled water from Scotland. Your wireless phone might have been made in Taiwan or Korea. The clothes you wear might be designed in Italy and manufactured in China. The toys you give to a child might have come from India. The car you drive might come from Japan, Germany, or Korea. The gasoline in the tank might be refined from crude oil from Saudi Arabia, Mexico, or Nigeria. As a worker, if your job is involved with farming, machinery, airplanes, cars, scientific instruments, or many other technology-related industries, the odds are good that a hearty proportion of the sales of your employer—and hence the money that pays your salary—comes from export sales. We are all linked by international trade, and the volume of that trade has grown dramatically in the last few decades.\nThe first wave of globalization started in the nineteenth century and lasted up to the beginning of World War I. Over that time, global exports as a share of global GDP rose from less than 1% of GDP in 1820 to 9% of GDP in 1913. As the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman of Princeton University wrote in 1995:\nIt is a late-twentieth-century conceit that we invented the global economy just yesterday. In fact, world markets achieved an impressive degree of integration during the second half of the nineteenth century. Indeed, if one wants a specific date for the beginning of a truly global economy, one might well choose 1869, the year in which both the Suez Canal and the Union Pacific railroad were completed. By the eve of the First World War steamships and railroads had created markets for standardized commodities, like wheat and wool, that were fully global in their reach. Even the global flow of information was better than modern observers, focused on electronic technology, tend to realize: the first submarine telegraph cable was laid under the Atlantic in 1858, and by 1900 all of the world’s major economic regions could effectively communicate instantaneously.\nThis first wave of globalization crashed to a halt early in the twentieth century. World War I severed many economic connections. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, many nations misguidedly tried to fix their own economies by reducing foreign trade with others. World War II further hindered international trade. Global flows of goods and financial capital were rebuilt only slowly after World War II. It was not until the early 1980s that global economic forces again became as important, relative to the size of the world economy, as they were before World War I.",

That means, that Samsung is both the biggest supplier and biggest competitor for Apple.\nWhy do these two firms work together to produce the iPhone? To understand the economic logic behind international trade, you have to accept, as these firms do, that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange. Samsung is one of the world’s largest electronics parts suppliers.

    "text": "6.2 Absolute and Comparative Advantage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nDefine absolute advantage, comparative advantage, and opportunity costs\nExplain the gains of trade created when a country specializes\n\n\n\nThe American statesman Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) once wrote: “No nation was ever ruined by trade.” Many economists would express their attitudes toward international trade in an even more positive manner. The evidence that international trade confers overall benefits on economies is pretty strong. Trade has accompanied economic growth in the United States and around the world. Many of the national economies that have shown the most rapid growth in the last several decades—for example, Japan, South Korea, China, and India—have done so by dramatically orienting their economies toward international trade. There is no modern example of a country that has shut itself off from world trade and yet prospered. To understand the benefits of trade, or why we trade in the first place, we need to understand the concepts of comparative and absolute advantage.\nIn 1817, David Ricardo, a businessman, economist, and member of the British Parliament, wrote a treatise called On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation. In this treatise, Ricardo argued that specialization and free trade benefit all trading partners, even those that may be relatively inefficient. To see what he meant, we must be able to distinguish between absolute and comparative advantage.\nA country has an absolute advantage over another country in producing a good if it uses fewer resources to produce that good. Absolute advantage can be the result of a country’s natural endowment. For example, extracting oil in Saudi Arabia is pretty much just a matter of “drilling a hole.” Producing oil in other countries can require considerable exploration and costly technologies for drilling and extraction—if they have any oil at all. The United States has some of the richest farmland in the world, making it easier to grow corn and wheat than in many other countries. Guatemala and Colombia have climates especially suited for growing coffee. Chile and Zambia have some of the world’s richest copper mines. As some have argued, “geography is destiny.” Chile will provide copper and Guatemala will produce coffee, and they will trade. When each country has a product others need and it can produce it with fewer resources in one country than in another, then it is easy to imagine all parties benefitting from trade. However, thinking about trade just in terms of geography and absolute advantage is incomplete. Trade really occurs because of comparative advantage.\nRecall from the chapter Choice in a World of Scarcity that a country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods. The question each country or company should be asking when it trades is this: “What do we give up to produce this good?” It should be no surprise that the concept of comparative advantage is based on this idea of opportunity cost from Choice in a World of Scarcity. For example, if Zambia focuses its resources on producing copper, it cannot use its labor, land and financial resources to produce other goods such as corn. As a result, Zambia gives up the opportunity to produce corn. How do we quantify the cost in terms of other goods? Simplify the problem and assume that Zambia just needs labor to produce copper and corn. The companies that produce either copper or corn tell you that it takes two hours to mine a ton of copper and one hour to harvest a bushel of corn. This means the opportunity cost of producing a ton of copper is two bushels of corn. The next section develops absolute and comparative advantage in greater detail and relates them to trade.\n\n6.2.1 A Numerical Example of Absolute and Comparative Advantage\n\nVideo - Comparative Advantage\n\n    \n\n\nConsider a hypothetical world with two countries, Saudi Arabia and the United States, and two products, oil and corn. Further assume that consumers in both countries desire both these goods. These goods are homogeneous, meaning that consumers/producers cannot differentiate between corn or oil from either country. There is only one resource available in both countries, labor hours. Saudi Arabia can produce oil with fewer resources, while the United States can produce corn with fewer resources. Table 17.1 illustrates the advantages of the two countries, expressed in terms of how many hours it takes to produce one unit of each good.\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: How Many Hours It Takes to Produce Oil and Corn\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nOil (hours per barrel)\nCorn (hours per bushel)\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\n1\n4\n\n\nUnited States\n2\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Table 17.1, Saudi Arabia has an absolute advantage in producing oil because it only takes an hour to produce a barrel of oil compared to two hours in the United States. The United States has an absolute advantage in producing corn.\nTo simplify, let’s say that Saudi Arabia and the United States each have 100 worker hours (see Table 6.2). Figure 6.2 illustrates what each country is capable of producing on its own using a production possibility frontier (PPF) graph. Recall from Choice in a World of Scarcity that the production possibilities frontier shows the maximum amount that each country can produce given its limited resources, in this case workers, and its level of technology.\n\n\n\nTable 6.2: Production Possibilities before Trade\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nOil Prod. using 100 worker hours (barrels)\nCorn Prod. using 100 worker hours (bushels)\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\n100 or\n25\n\n\nUnited States\n50 or\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Production Possibilities Frontiers. Panel (a) Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil at maximum and zero corn (point A), or 25 bushels of corn and zero oil (point B). It can also produce other combinations of oil and corn if it wants to consume both goods, such as at point C. Here it chooses to produce/consume 60 barrels of oil, leaving 40 work hours that to allocate to produce 10 bushels of corn, using the data in Table. (b) If the United States produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum, 50 barrels and zero corn (point A'), or at the other extreme, it can produce a maximum of 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B'). Other combinations of both oil and corn are possible, such as point C'. All points above the frontiers are impossible to produce given the current level of resources and technology.\n\n\n\nThese graphs illustrate the production possibilities frontier before trade for both Saudi Arabia and the United States using the data in the table titled “Production Possibilities before Trade”. The x-axis plots corn production, measured by bushels, and the y-axis plots oil, in terms of barrels. All points above the frontier are impossible to produce given the current level of resources and technology.\n(a) Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil at maximum and zero corn (point A), or 25 bushels of corn and zero oil (point B). It can also produce other combinations of oil and corn if it wants to consume both goods, such as at point C. Here it chooses to produce/consume 60 barrels of oil, leaving 40 work hours that to allocate to produce 10 bushels of corn, using the data in Table.\n(b) If the United States produces only oil, it can produce, at maximum, 50 barrels and zero corn (point A'), or at the other extreme, it can produce a maximum of 100 bushels of corn and no oil (point B'). Other combinations of both oil and corn are possible, such as point C'. All points above the frontiers are impossible to produce given the current level of resources and technology.\nArguably Saudi and U.S. consumers desire both oil and corn to live. Let’s say that before trade occurs, both countries produce and consume at point C or C'. Thus, before trade, the Saudi Arabian economy will devote 60 worker hours to produce oil, as Table shows. Given the information in Table, this choice implies that it produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil. With the remaining 40 worker hours, since it needs four hours to produce a bushel of corn, it can produce only 10 bushels. To be at point C', the U.S. economy devotes 40 worker hours to produce 20 barrels of oil and it can allocate the remaining worker hours to produce 60 bushels of corn.\n\n\n\nTable 6.3: Production before Trade\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nOil Production (barrels)\nCorn Production (bushels)\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia (C)\n60\n10\n\n\nUnited States (C')\n20\n60\n\n\nTotal World Production\n80\n70\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe slope of the production possibility frontier illustrates the opportunity cost of producing oil in terms of corn. Using all its resources, the United States can produce 50 barrels of oil or 100 bushels of corn; therefore, the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn—or the slope is 1/2. Thus, in the U.S. production possibility frontier graph, every increase in oil production of one barrel implies a decrease of two bushels of corn. Saudi Arabia can produce 100 barrels of oil or 25 bushels of corn.\nThe opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is the loss of 1/4 of a bushel of corn that Saudi workers could otherwise have produced. In terms of corn, notice that Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil. Table 6.4 summarizes these calculations.\n\n\n\nTable 6.4: Opportunity Cost and Comparative Advantage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nOpportunity cost of one unit: Oil\n| (in terms of corn)\nOpportunity cost of one unit: Corn\n| (in terms of oil)\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n4\n\n\nUnited States\n2\n\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain recall that we defined comparative advantage as the opportunity cost of producing goods. Since Saudi Arabia gives up the least to produce a barrel of oil, (\\(\\frac{1}{4} &lt; 2\\) in Table 6.4) it has a comparative advantage in oil production. The United States gives up the least to produce a bushel of corn, so it has a comparative advantage in corn production.\nIn this example, there is symmetry between absolute and comparative advantage. Saudi Arabia needs fewer worker hours to produce oil (absolute advantage, see Table 6.3), and also gives up the least in terms of other goods to produce oil (comparative advantage, see Table 6.4). Such symmetry is not always the case, as we will show after we have discussed gains from trade fully, but first, read the following Clear It Up feature to make sure you understand why the PPF line in the graphs is straight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCAN A PRODUCTION POSSIBILITY FRONTIER BE STRAIGHT?\nWhen you first met the production possibility frontier (PPF) in the chapter on Choice in a World of Scarcity we drew it with an outward-bending shape. This shape illustrated that as we transferred inputs from producing one good to another—like from education to health services—there were increasing opportunity costs. In the examples in this chapter, we draw the PPFs as straight lines, which means that opportunity costs are constant. When we transfer a marginal unit of labor away from growing corn and toward producing oil, the decline in the quantity of corn and the increase in the quantity of oil is always the same.\nIn reality this is possible only if the contribution of additional workers to output did not change as the scale of production changed. The linear production possibilities frontier is a less realistic model, but a straight line simplifies calculations. It also illustrates economic themes like absolute and comparative advantage just as clearly.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Gains from Trade\nConsider the trading positions of the United States and Saudi Arabia after they have specialized and traded in Table 6.5. Before trade, Saudi Arabia produces/consumes 60 barrels of oil and 10 bushels of corn. The United States produces/consumes 20 barrels of oil and 60 bushels of corn. Given their current production levels, if the United States can trade an amount of corn fewer than 60 bushels and receives in exchange an amount of oil greater than 20 barrels, it will gain from trade.\nWith trade, the United States can consume more of both goods than it did without specialization and trade. (Recall that the chapter Welcome to Economics! defined specialization as it applies to workers and firms. Economists also use specialization to describe the occurrence when a country shifts resources to focus on producing a good that offers comparative advantage.) Similarly, if Saudi Arabia can trade an amount of oil less than 60 barrels and receive in exchange an amount of corn greater than 10 bushels, it will have more of both goods than it did before specialization and trade. Table illustrates the range of trades that would benefit both sides.\n\n\n\nTable 6.5: The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Saudi Arabia\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. economy, after specialization,\n| will benefit if it: ,\nThe Saudi Arabian economy,\nafter specialization will benefit\n| if it:\n\n\n\n\nExports no more than 60 bushels of corn\nImports at least 10 bushels of corn\n\n\nImports at least 20 barrels of oil\nExports less than 60 barrels of oil\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe underlying reason why trade benefits both sides is rooted in the concept of opportunity cost, as the following Clear It Up feature explains. If Saudi Arabia wishes to expand domestic production of corn in a world without international trade, then based on its opportunity costs it must give up four barrels of oil for every one additional bushel of corn. If Saudi Arabia could find a way to give up less than four barrels of oil for an additional bushel of corn (or equivalently, to receive more than one bushel of corn for four barrels of oil), it would be better off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITY COSTS AND GAINS FROM TRADE?\nThe range of trades that will benefit each country is based on the country’s opportunity cost of producing each good. The United States can produce 100 bushels of corn or 50 barrels of oil. For the United States, the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil is two bushels of corn. If we divide the numbers above by 50, we get the same ratio: one barrel of oil is equivalent to two bushels of corn, or (100/50 = 2 and 50/50 = 1).\nIn a trade with Saudi Arabia, if the United States is going to give up 100 bushels of corn in exports, it must import at least 50 barrels of oil to be just as well off. Clearly, to gain from trade it needs to be able to gain more than a half barrel of oil for its bushel of corn—or why trade at all?\n\n\nRecall that David Ricardo argued that if each country specializes in its comparative advantage, it will benefit from trade, and total global output will increase. How can we show gains from trade as a result of comparative advantage and specialization? Table 6.6 shows the output assuming that each country specializes in its comparative advantage and produces no other good. This is 100% specialization. Specialization leads to an increase in total world production. (Compare the total world production in Table 6.2 to that in Table 6.6.)\n\n\n\nTable 6.6: How Specialization Expands Output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nQuantity produced after 100%\n| specialization — Oil (barrels)\nQuantity produced after 100%\n| specialization — Corn (bushels)\n\n\n\n\nSaudi Arabia\n100\n0\n\n\nUnited States\n0\n100\n\n\nWorld Production\n100\n100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we did not have complete specialization, as in Table 6.6? Would there still be gains from trade? Consider another example, such as when the United States and Saudi Arabia start at C and C', respectively, as Figure 6.3 shows. Consider what occurs when trade is allowed and the United States exports 20 bushels of corn to Saudi Arabia in exchange for 20 barrels of oil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Production Possibilities Frontier in Saudi Arabia. Trade allows a country to go beyond its domestic production-possibility frontier\n\n\n\nOn this graph, Corn is on the x-axis with a maximum production of 25 bushels and oil is on the y-axis with a maximum production of 100 barrels. Saudi Arabia begins producing and consuming at point C (coordinates 10, 60). If the “trade price” is 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels of corn, the Saudis end up at D (coordinates 30, 40).\nStarting at point C, which shows Saudi oil production of 60, reduce Saudi oil domestic oil consumption by 20, since 20 is exported to the United States and exchanged for 20 units of corn. This enables Saudi to reach point D, where oil consumption is now 40 barrels and corn consumption has increased to 30 (see Figure). Notice that even without 100% specialization, if the “trading price,” in this case 20 barrels of oil for 20 bushels of corn, is greater than the country’s opportunity cost, the Saudis will gain from trade. Since the post-trade consumption point D is beyond its production possibility frontier, Saudi Arabia has gained from trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nA country has an absolute advantage in those products in which it has a productivity edge over other countries; it takes fewer resources to produce a product.\nA country has a comparative advantage when it can produce a good at a lower cost in terms of other goods.\nCountries that specialize based on comparative advantage gain from trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrue or False: The source of comparative advantage must be natural elements like climate and mineral deposits.

    "text": "6.3 What Happens When a Country Has an Absolute Advantage in All Goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nShow the relationship between production costs and comparative advantage\nIdentify situations of mutually beneficial trade\nIdentify trade benefits by considering opportunity costs\n\n\n\nWhat happens to the possibilities for trade if one country has an absolute advantage in everything? This is typical for high-income countries that often have well-educated workers, technologically advanced equipment, and the most up-to-date production processes. These high-income countries can produce all products with fewer resources than a low-income country. If the high-income country is more productive across the board, will there still be gains from trade? Good students of Ricardo understand that trade is about mutually beneficial exchange. Even when one country has an absolute advantage in all products, trade can still benefit both sides. This is because gains from trade come from specializing in one’s comparative advantage.\n\n6.3.1 Production Possibilities and Comparative Advantage\nConsider the example of trade between the United States and Mexico described in Table 6.7. In this example, it takes four U.S. workers to produce 1,000 pairs of shoes, but it takes five Mexican workers to do so. It takes one U.S. worker to produce 1,000 refrigerators, but it takes four Mexican workers to do so. The United States has an absolute advantage in productivity with regard to both shoes and refrigerators; that is, it takes fewer workers in the United States than in Mexico to produce both a given number of shoes and a given number of refrigerators.\n\n\n\nTable 6.7: Resources Needed to Produce Shoes and Refrigerators\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nNumber of Workers needed\n| to produce 1,000 units — Shoes\nNumber of Workers needed\n| to produce 1,000 units — Refrigerators\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n4 workers\n1 worker\n\n\nMexico\n5 workers\n4 workers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbsolute advantage simply compares the productivity of a worker between countries. It answers the question, “How many inputs do I need to produce shoes in Mexico?” Comparative advantage asks this same question slightly differently. Instead of comparing how many workers it takes to produce a good, it asks, “How much am I giving up to produce this good in this country?” Another way of looking at this is that comparative advantage identifies the good for which the producer’s absolute advantage is relatively larger, or where the producer’s absolute productivity disadvantage is relatively smaller.\nThe United States can produce 1,000 shoes with four-fifths as many workers as Mexico (four versus five), but it can produce 1,000 refrigerators with only one-quarter as many workers (one versus four). So, the comparative advantage of the United States, where its absolute productivity advantage is relatively greatest, lies with refrigerators, and Mexico’s comparative advantage, where its absolute productivity disadvantage is least, is in the production of shoes.\n\n\n6.3.2 Benefits from Specialization (The Ricardian Trade Model)\nWhen nations increase production in their area of comparative advantage and trade with each other, both countries can benefit. Again, the production possibility frontier is a useful tool to visualize this benefit. This theory was developed by British Economist David Ricardo (1772--1823).\nConsider a situation where the United States and Mexico each have 40 workers. For example, as Table 6.8 shows, if the United States divides its labor so that 40 workers are making shoes, then, since it takes four workers in the United States to make 1,000 shoes, a total of 10,000 shoes will be produced. (If four workers can make 1,000 shoes, then 40 workers will make 10,000 shoes). If the 40 workers in the United States are making refrigerators, and each worker can produce 1,000 refrigerators, then a total of 40,000 refrigerators will be produced.\n\n\n\nTable 6.8: Production Possibilities before Trade with Complete Specialization\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nShoe Production — using 40 workers\nRefrigerator Production — using 40 workers\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\n10,000 shoes or\n40,000 refrigerators\n\n\nMexico\n8,000 shoes or\n10,000 refrigerators\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs always, the slope of the production possibility frontier for each country is the opportunity cost of one refrigerator in terms of foregone shoe production–when labor is transferred from producing the latter to producing the former (see Figure 6.4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Production Possibility Frontiers (a) With 40 workers, the United States can produce either 10,000 shoes and zero refrigerators or 40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. (b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. All other points on the production possibility line are possible combinations of the two goods that can be produced given current resources. Point A on both graphs is where the countries start producing and consuming before trade. Point B is where they end up after trade.\n\n\n\nThe graphs show two production possibility frontiers (PPFs) for the United States (graph a) and Mexico (graph b). The PPFs are linear. The x-axis plots refrigerators and the y-axis plots shoes. (a) With 40 workers, the United States can produce either 10,000 shoes and zero refrigerators or 40,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. (b) With 40 workers, Mexico can produce a maximum of 8,000 shoes and zero refrigerators, or 10,000 refrigerators and zero shoes. Point B is where they end up after trade.\nLet’s say that, in the situation before trade, each nation prefers to produce a combination of shoes and refrigerators that is shown at point A. Table 6.9 shows the output of each good for each country and the total output for the two countries.\n\n\n\nTable 6.9: Total Production at Point A before Trade\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCurrent Shoe Production\nCurrent Refrigerator Production\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\n5,000\n20,000\n\n\nMexico\n4,000\n5,000\n\n\nTotal\n9,000\n25,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing with this scenario, suppose that each country transfers some amount of labor toward its area of comparative advantage. For example, the United States transfers six workers away from shoes and toward producing refrigerators. As a result, U.S. production of shoes decreases by 1,500 units (6/4 × 1,000), while its production of refrigerators increases by 6,000 (that is, 6/1 × 1,000). Mexico also moves production toward its area of comparative advantage, transferring 10 workers away from refrigerators and toward production of shoes. As a result, production of refrigerators in Mexico falls by 2,500 (10/4 × 1,000), but production of shoes increases by 2,000 pairs (10/5 × 1,000). Notice that when both countries shift production toward each of their comparative advantages (what they are relatively better at), their combined production of both goods rises, as shown in Table 6.10.\nThe reduction of shoe production by 1,500 pairs in the United States is more than offset by the gain of 2,000 pairs of shoes in Mexico, while the reduction of 2,500 refrigerators in Mexico is more than offset by the additional 6,000 refrigerators produced in the United States.\n\n\n\nTable 6.10: Shifting Production Toward Comparative Advantage Raises Total Output\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nShoe Production\nRefrigerator Production\n\n\n\n\nU.S.\n3,500\n26,000\n\n\nMexico\n6,000\n2,500\n\n\nTotal\n9,500\n28,500\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis numerical example illustrates the remarkable insight of comparative advantage: even when one country has an absolute advantage in all goods and another country has an absolute disadvantage in all goods, both countries can still benefit from trade. Even though the United States has an absolute advantage in producing both refrigerators and shoes, it makes economic sense for it to specialize in the good for which it has a comparative advantage. The United States will export refrigerators and in return import shoes.\n\n\n6.3.3 How Opportunity Cost Sets the Boundaries of Trade\nThis example shows that both parties can benefit from specializing in their comparative advantages and trading. By using the opportunity costs in this example, it is possible to identify the range of possible trades that would benefit each country.\nMexico started out, before specialization and trade, producing 4,000 pairs of shoes and 5,000 refrigerators (see Figure and Table). Then, in the numerical example given, Mexico shifted production toward its comparative advantage and produced 6,000 pairs of shoes but only 2,500 refrigerators. Thus, if Mexico can export no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes (giving up 2,000 pairs of shoes) in exchange for imports of at least 2,500 refrigerators (a gain of 2,500 refrigerators), it will be able to consume more of both goods than before trade. Mexico will be unambiguously better off. Conversely, the United States started off, before specialization and trade, producing 5,000 pairs of shoes and 20,000 refrigerators. In the example, it then shifted production toward its comparative advantage, producing only 3,500 shoes but 26,000 refrigerators. If the United States can export no more than 6,000 refrigerators in exchange for imports of at least 1,500 pairs of shoes, it will be able to consume more of both goods and will be unambiguously better off.\nThe range of trades that can benefit both nations is shown in Table 6.11. For example, a trade where the U.S. exports 4,000 refrigerators to Mexico in exchange for 1,800 pairs of shoes would benefit both sides, in the sense that both countries would be able to consume more of both goods than in a world without trade.\nThe Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Mexico\n\n\n\nTable 6.11: The Range of Trades That Benefit Both the United States and Mexico\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. economy, after specialization will benefit if it:\n================================ Exports fewer than 6,000 refrigerators\nThe Mexican economy, after specialization will benefit if it:\n================================ Imports at least 2,500 refrigerators\n\n\nImports at least 1,500 pairs of shoes\nExports no more than 2,000 pairs of shoes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrade allows each country to take advantage of lower opportunity costs in the other country. If Mexico wants to produce more refrigerators without trade, it must face its domestic opportunity costs and reduce shoe production. If Mexico, instead, produces more shoes and then trades for refrigerators made in the United States, where the opportunity cost of producing refrigerators is lower, Mexico can in effect take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of refrigerators in the United States. Conversely, when the United States specializes in its comparative advantage of refrigerator production and trades for shoes produced in Mexico, international trade allows the United States to take advantage of the lower opportunity cost of shoe production in Mexico.\nThe theory of comparative advantage explains why countries trade: they have different comparative advantages. It shows that the gains from international trade result from pursuing comparative advantage and producing at a lower opportunity cost. The following Work It Out feature shows how to calculate absolute and comparative advantage and the way to apply them to a country’s production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCALCULATING ABSOLUTE AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE\nIn Canada a worker can produce 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. In Venezuela, a worker can produce 60 barrels of oil or 30 tons of lumber.\n\n\n\nTable 6.12: 2 Country Example\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nOil (barrels)\nLumber (tons)\n\n\n\n\nCanada\n20 or\n40\n\n\nVenezuela\n60 or\n30\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho has the absolute advantage in the production of oil or lumber? How can you tell?\nWhich country has a comparative advantage in the production of oil?\nWhich country has a comparative advantage in producing lumber?\nIn this example, is absolute advantage the same as comparative advantage, or not?\nIn what product should Canada specialize? In what product should Venezuela specialize?\n\n\nStep 1.\n\nMake a table like Table 6.12.\n\nStep 2.\n\nTo calculate absolute advantage, look at the larger of the numbers for each product. One worker in Canada can produce more lumber (40 tons versus 30 tons), so Canada has the absolute advantage in lumber. One worker in Venezuela can produce 60 barrels of oil compared to a worker in Canada who can produce only 20.\n\nStep 3.\n\nTo calculate comparative advantage, find the opportunity cost of producing one barrel of oil in both countries. The country with the lowest opportunity cost has the comparative advantage. With the same labor time, Canada can produce either 20 barrels of oil or 40 tons of lumber. So in effect, 20 barrels of oil is equivalent to 40 tons of lumber: 20 oil = 40 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 20 to calculate the opportunity cost of one barrel of oil in Canada. 20/20 oil = 40/20 lumber. 1 oil = 2 lumber. To produce one additional barrel of oil in Canada has an opportunity cost of 2 lumber. Calculate the same way for Venezuela: 60 oil = 30 lumber. Divide both sides of the equation by 60. One oil in Venezuela has an opportunity cost of 1/2 lumber. Because 1/2 lumber &lt; 2 lumber, Venezuela has the comparative advantage in producing oil.\n\nStep 4.\n\nCalculate the opportunity cost of one lumber by reversing the numbers, with lumber on the left side of the equation. In Canada, 40 lumber is equivalent in labor time to 20 barrels of oil: 40 lumber = 20 oil. Divide each side of the equation by 40. The opportunity cost of one lumber is 1/2 oil. In Venezuela, the equivalent labor time will produce 30 lumber or 60 oil: 30 lumber = 60 oil. Divide each side by 30. One lumber has an opportunity cost of two oil. Canada has the lower opportunity cost in producing lumber.\n\nStep 5.\n\nIn this example, absolute advantage is the same as comparative advantage. Canada has the absolute and comparative advantage in lumber; Venezuela has the absolute and comparative advantage in oil.\n\nStep 6.\n\nCanada should specialize in the commodity for which it has a relative lower opportunity cost, which is lumber, and Venezuela should specialize in oil. Canada will be exporting lumber and importing oil, and Venezuela will be exporting oil and importing lumber.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.4 Terms of Trade and Consumption Possibilities Curve\n\nThe terms of trade (TOT) is the rate at which units of one product can be exchanged for units of another product. It is typically expressed as the price of the export good over the price of the import good:\n\n\\[\\text{TOT}=\\frac{P_{\\text{Export-Good}}}{P_{\\text{Import-Good}}}\\]\n\nThe consumption possibilities curve shows the combinations of two goods that a nation can consume when it specializes in producing one good and trades with another nation.\n\n\n\n6.3.5 Comparative Advantage Goes Camping\nTo build an intuitive understanding of how comparative advantage can benefit all parties, set aside examples that involve national economies for a moment and consider the situation of a group of friends who decide to go camping together. The six friends have a wide range of skills and experiences, but one person in particular, Jethro, has done lots of camping before and is also a great athlete. Jethro has an absolute advantage in all aspects of camping: he is faster at carrying a backpack, gathering firewood, paddling a canoe, setting up tents, making a meal, and washing up. So here is the question: Because Jethro has an absolute productivity advantage in everything, should he do all the work?\nOf course not! Even if Jethro is willing to work like a mule while everyone else sits around, he, like all mortals, only has 24 hours in a day. If everyone sits around and waits for Jethro to do everything, not only will Jethro be an unhappy camper, but there will not be much output for his group of six friends to consume. The theory of comparative advantage suggests that everyone will benefit if they figure out their areas of comparative advantage—that is, the area of camping where their productivity disadvantage is least, compared to Jethro. For example, it may be that Jethro is 80% faster at building fires and cooking meals than anyone else, but only 20% faster at gathering firewood and 10% faster at setting up tents. In that case, Jethro should focus on building fires and making meals, and others should attend to the other tasks, each according to where their productivity disadvantage is smallest. If the campers coordinate their efforts according to comparative advantage, they can all gain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nEven when a country has high levels of productivity in all goods, it can still benefit from trade.\nGains from trade come about as a result of comparative advantage.\nBy specializing in a good that it gives up the least to produce, a country can produce more and offer that additional output for sale.\nIf other countries specialize in the area of their comparative advantage as well and trade, the highly productive country is able to benefit from a lower opportunity cost of production in other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs it possible to have a comparative advantage in the production of a good but not to have an absolute advantage? Explain.\nHow does comparative advantage lead to gains from trade?\nYou just overheard your friend say the following: “Poor countries like Malawi have no absolute advantages. They have poor soil, low investments in formal education and hence low-skill workers, no capital, and no natural resources to speak of. Because they have no advantage, they cannot benefit from trade.” How would you respond?\nYou just got a job in Washington, D.C. You move into an apartment with some acquaintances. All your roommates, however, are slackers and do not clean up after themselves. You, on the other hand, can clean faster than each of them. You determine that you are 70% faster at dishes and 10% faster with vacuuming. All of these tasks have to be done daily. Which jobs should you assign to your roommates to get the most free time overall? Assume you have the same number of hours to devote to cleaning. Now, since you are faster, you seem to get done quicker than your roommate. What sorts of problems may this create? Can you imagine a trade-related analogy to this problem?",

    "text": "6.4 Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nIdentify at least two advantages of intra-industry trading\nExplain the relationship between economies of scale and intra-industry trade\n\n\n\nAbsolute and comparative advantages explain a great deal about global trading patterns. For example, they help to explain the patterns that we noted at the start of this chapter, like why you may be eating fresh fruit from Chile or Mexico, or why lower productivity regions like Africa and Latin America are able to sell a substantial proportion of their exports to higher productivity regions like the European Union and North America. Comparative advantage, however, at least at first glance, does not seem especially well-suited to explain other common patterns of international trade.\n\n6.4.1 The Prevalence of Intra-industry Trade between Similar Economies\nThe theory of comparative advantage suggests that trade should happen between economies with large differences in opportunity costs of production. Roughly half of all world trade involves shipping goods between the fairly similar high-income economies of the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Mexico, and China (see Table 6.13).\n\n\n\nTable 6.13: Where U.S. Exports Go and U.S. Imports Originate (2015)(Source: https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/ft900.pdf)\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nU.S. Exports Go to ...\nU.S. Imports Come from ...\n\n\n\n\nEuropean Union\n19.0%\n21.0%\n\n\nCanada\n22.0%\n14.0%\n\n\nJapan\n4.0%\n6.0%\n\n\nMexico\n15.0%\n13.0%\n\n\nChina\n8.0%\n20.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, the theory of comparative advantage suggests that each economy should specialize to a degree in certain products, and then exchange those products. A high proportion of trade, however, is intra-industry trade—that is, trade of goods within the same industry from one country to another. For example, the United States produces and exports autos and imports autos.\nTable 6.14 shows some of the largest categories of U.S. exports and imports. In all of these categories, the United States is both a substantial exporter and a substantial importer of goods from the same industry. In 2014, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States exported $146 billion worth of autos, and imported $327 billion worth of autos. About 60% of U.S. trade and 60% of European trade is intra-industry trade.\n\n\n\nTable 6.14: Some Intra-Industry U.S. Exports and Imports in 2014(Source: http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/tradnewsrelease.htm)\n\n\n\n\n\nSome U.S. Exports\nQuantity of Exports ($ billions)\nQuantity of Imports ($ billions)\n\n\n\n\nAutos\n$146\n$327\n\n\nFood and beverages\n$144\n$126\n\n\nCapital goods\n$550\n$551\n\n\nConsumer goods\n$199\n$558\n\n\nIndustrial supplies\n$507\n$665\n\n\nOther transportation\n$45\n$55\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do similar high-income economies engage in intra-industry trade? What can be the economic benefit of having workers of fairly similar skills making cars, computers, machinery and other products which are then shipped across the oceans to and from the United States, the European Union, and Japan? There are two reasons: (1) The division of labor leads to learning, innovation, and unique skills; and (2) economies of scale.\n\n\n6.4.2 Gains from Specialization and Learning\nConsider the category of machinery, where the U.S. economy has considerable intra-industry trade. Machinery comes in many varieties, so the United States may be exporting machinery for manufacturing with wood, but importing machinery for photographic processing. The underlying reason why a country like the United States, Japan, or Germany produces one kind of machinery rather than another is usually not related to U.S., German, or Japanese firms and workers having generally higher or lower skills. It is just that, in working on very specific and particular products, firms in certain countries develop unique and different skills.\nSpecialization in the world economy can be very finely split. In fact, recent years have seen a trend in international trade, which economists call splitting up the value chain. The value chain describes how a good is produced in stages. As indicated in the beginning of the chapter, producing the iPhone involves designing and engineering the phone in the United States, supplying parts from Korea, assembling the parts in China, and advertising and marketing in the United States. Thanks in large part to improvements in communication technology, sharing information, and transportation, it has become easier to split up the value chain. Instead of production in a single large factory, different firms operating in various places and even different countries can divide the value chain. Because firms split up the value chain, international trade often does not involve nations trading whole finished products like automobiles or refrigerators. Instead, it involves shipping more specialized goods like, say, automobile dashboards or the shelving that fits inside refrigerators. Intra-industry trade between similar countries produces economic gains because it allows workers and firms to learn and innovate on particular products—and often to focus on very particular parts of the value chain.\n\n\n6.4.3 Economies of Scale, Competition, Variety\nA second broad reason that intra-industry trade between similar nations produces economic gains involves economies of scale. The concept of economies of scale, as we introduced in Production, Costs and Industry Structure, means that as the scale of output goes up, average costs of production decline—at least up to a point.\nFigure 6.5 illustrates economies of scale for a plant producing toaster ovens. The horizontal axis of the figure shows the quantity of production by a certain firm or at a certain manufacturing plant. The vertical axis measures the average cost of production. Production plant S produces a small level of output at 30 units and has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven. Plant M produces at a medium level of output at 50 units, and has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Plant L produces 150 units of output with an average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Although plant V can produce 200 units of output, it still has the same unit cost as Plant L.\nIn this example, a small or medium plant, like S or M, will not be able to compete in the market with a large or a very large plant like L or V, because the firm that operates L or V will be able to produce and sell its output at a lower price. In this example, economies of scale operate up to point L, but beyond point L to V, the additional scale of production does not continue to reduce average costs of production.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Economies of Scale. Production Plant S, has an average cost of production of $30 per toaster oven. Production plant M has an average cost of production of $20 per toaster oven. Production plant L has an average cost of production of only $10 per toaster oven. Production plant V still has an average cost of production of $10 per toaster oven. Thus, production plant M can produce toaster ovens more cheaply than plant S because of economies of scale, and plants L or V can produce more cheaply than S or M because of economies of scale. However, the economies of scale end at an output level of 150. Plant V, despite being larger, cannot produce more cheaply on average than plant L.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows declining average costs. The x-axis plots the quantity of production or the scale of the plant and the y-axis plots the average costs. The average cost curve is a declining function, starting at (30, 30) with plant S, declining at a decreasing rate to (150, 10) with plant L, and (200, 10) with plant V, as explained in the text.\nThe concept of economies of scale becomes especially relevant to international trade when it enables one or two large producers to supply the entire country. For example, a single large automobile factory could probably supply all the cars consumers purchase in a smaller economy like the United Kingdom or Belgium in a given year. However, if a country has only one or two large factories producing cars, and no international trade, then consumers in that country would have relatively little choice between kinds of cars (other than the color of the paint and other nonessential options). Little or no competition will exist between different car manufacturers.\nInternational trade provides a way to combine the lower average production costs that come from economies of scale and still have competition and variety for consumers. Large automobile factories in different countries can make and sell their products around the world. If General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were the only players in the U.S. automobile market, the level of competition and consumer choice would be considerably lower than when U.S. carmakers must face competition from Toyota, Honda, Suzuki, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Volkswagen, Kia, Hyundai, BMW, Subaru, and others. Greater competition brings with it innovation and responsiveness to what consumers want. America’s car producers make far better cars now than they did several decades ago, and much of the reason is competitive pressure, especially from East Asian and European carmakers.\n\n\n6.4.4 Dynamic Comparative Advantage\nThe sources of gains from intra-industry trade between similar economies—namely, the learning that comes from a high degree of specialization and splitting up the value chain and from economies of scale—do not contradict the earlier theory of comparative advantage. Instead, they help to broaden the concept.\nIn intra-industry trade, climate or geography do not determine the level of worker productivity. Even the general level of education or skill does not determine it. Instead, how firms engage in specific learning about specialized products, including taking advantage of economies of scale determine the level of worker productivity. In this vision, comparative advantage can be dynamic—that is, it can evolve and change over time as one develops new skills and as manufacturers split the value chain in new ways. This line of thinking also suggests that countries are not destined to have the same comparative advantage forever, but must instead be flexible in response to ongoing changes in comparative advantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nA large share of global trade happens between high-income economies that are quite similar in having well-educated workers and advanced technology.\nThese countries practice intra-industry trade, in which they import and export the same products at the same time, like cars, machinery, and computers.\nIn the case of intra-industry trade between economies with similar income levels, the gains from trade come from specialized learning in very particular tasks and from economies of scale.\nSplitting up the value chain means that several stages of producing a good take place in different countries around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is intra-industry trade?\nWhat are the two main sources of economic gains from intra-industry trade?\nWhat is splitting up the value chain?\nDoes intra-industry trade contradict the theory of comparative advantage?\nDo consumers benefit from intra-industry trade?\nWhy might intra-industry trade seem surprising from the point of view of comparative advantage?",

    "text": "6.5 The Benefits of Reducing Barriers to International Trade\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain tarrifs as barriers to trade\nIdentify at least two benefits of reducing barriers to international trade\n\n\n\nTariffs are taxes that governments place on imported goods for a variety of reasons. Some of these reasons include protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and protecting against dumping. Traditionally, tariffs were used simply as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests. The World Trade Organization (WTO) is committed to lowering barriers to trade. The world’s nations meet through the WTO to negotiate how they can reduce barriers to trade, such as tariffs. WTO negotiations happen in “rounds,” where all countries negotiate one agreement to encourage trade, take a year or two off, and then start negotiating a new agreement. The current round of negotiations is called the Doha Round because it was officially launched in Doha, the capital city of Qatar, in November 2001. In 2009, economists from the World Bank summarized recent research and found that the Doha round of negotiations would increase the size of the world economy by $160 billion to $385 billion per year, depending on the precise deal that ended up being negotiated.\nIn the context of a global economy that currently produces more than $30 trillion of goods and services each year, this amount is not huge: it is an increase of 1% or less. But before dismissing the gains from trade too quickly, it is worth remembering two points.\nFirst, a gain of a few hundred billion dollars is enough money to deserve attention! Moreover, remember that this increase is not a one-time event; it would persist each year into the future.\nSecond, the estimate of gains may be on the low side because some of the gains from trade are not measured especially well in economic statistics. For example, it is difficult to measure the potential advantages to consumers of having a variety of products available and a greater degree of competition among producers. Perhaps the most important unmeasured factor is that trade between countries, especially when firms are splitting up the value chain of production, often involves a transfer of knowledge that can involve skills in production, technology, management, finance, and law.\nLow-income countries benefit more from trade than high-income countries do. In some ways, the giant U.S. economy has less need for international trade, because it can already take advantage of internal trade within its economy. However, many smaller national economies around the world, in regions like Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, have much more limited possibilities for trade inside their countries or their immediate regions. Without international trade, they may have little ability to benefit from comparative advantage, slicing up the value chain, or economies of scale. Moreover, smaller economies often have fewer competitive firms making goods within their economy, and thus firms have less pressure from other firms to provide the goods and prices that consumers want.\nThe economic gains from expanding international trade are measured in hundreds of billions of dollars, and the gains from international trade as a whole probably reach well into the trillions of dollars. The potential for gains from trade may be especially high among the smaller and lower-income countries of the world.\n\n6.5.1 From Interpersonal to International Trade\nMost people find it easy to believe that they, personally, would not be better off if they tried to grow and process all of their own food, to make all of their own clothes, to build their own cars and houses from scratch, and so on. Instead, we all benefit from living in economies where people and firms can specialize and trade with each other.\nThe benefits of trade do not stop at national boundaries, either. Earlier we explained that the division of labor could increase output for three reasons: (1) workers with different characteristics can specialize in the types of production where they have a comparative advantage; (2) firms and workers who specialize in a certain product become more productive with learning and practice; and (3) economies of scale. These three reasons apply from the individual and community level right up to the international level. If it makes sense to you that interpersonal, intercommunity, and interstate trade offer economic gains, it should make sense that international trade offers gains, too.\nInternational trade currently involves about $20 trillion worth of goods and services moving around the globe. Any economic force of that size, even if it confers overall benefits, is certain to cause disruption and controversy. This chapter has only made the case that trade brings economic benefits. Other chapters discuss, in detail, the public policy arguments over whether to restrict international trade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIT’S APPLE’S (GLOBAL) IPHONE\nApple Corporation uses a global platform to produce the iPhone. Now that you understand the concept of comparative advantage, you can see why the engineering and design of the iPhone is done in the United States. The United States has built up a comparative advantage over the years in designing and marketing products, and sacrifices fewer resources to design high-tech devices relative to other countries.\nChina has a comparative advantage in assembling the phone due to its large skilled labor force. Korea has a comparative advantage in producing components. Korea focuses its production by increasing its scale, learning better ways to produce screens and computer chips, and uses innovation to lower average costs of production. Apple, in turn, benefits because it can purchase these quality products at lower prices. Put the global assembly line together and you have the device with which we are all so familiar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nTariffs are placed on imported goods as a way of protecting sensitive industries, for humanitarian reasons, and for protection against dumping.\nTraditionally, tariffs were used as a political tool to protect certain vested economic, social, and cultural interests.\nThe WTO has been, and continues to be, a way for nations to meet and negotiate in order to reduce barriers to trade.\nThe gains of international trade are very large, especially for smaller countries, but are beneficial to all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the removal of trade barriers is so beneficial to international economic growth, why would a nation continue to restrict trade on some imported or exported products?\nAre the gains from international trade more likely to be relatively more important to large or small countries?\nIn World Trade Organization meetings, what do you think low-income countries lobby for?\nWhy might a low-income country put up barriers to trade, such as tariffs on imports?\nCan a nation’s comparative advantage change over time? What factors would make it change?",

    "text": "6.6 Measuring Trade Balances\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring Trade Balances\nTrade Balances in Historical and International Context\nTrade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital\nThe National Saving and Investment Identity\nThe Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses\nThe Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance\nExplain merchandise trade balance, current account balance, and unilateral transfers\nIdentify components of the U.S. current account balance\nCalculate the merchandise trade balance and current account balance using import and export data for a country\n\n\n\nThe balance of trade (or trade balance) is any gap between a nation’s dollar value of its exports, or what its producers sell abroad, and a nation’s dollar value of imports, or the foreign-made products and services that households and businesses purchase. Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that if exports exceed imports, the economy has a trade surplus. If imports exceed exports, the economy has a trade deficit. If exports and imports are equal, then trade is balanced, but what happens when trade is out of balance and large trade surpluses or deficits exist?\nGermany, for example, has had substantial trade surpluses in recent decades, in which exports have greatly exceeded imports. According to the Central Intelligence Agency’s The World Factbook, in 2016, Germany ran a trade surplus of $295 billion. In contrast, the U.S. economy in recent decades has experienced large trade deficits, in which imports have considerably exceeded exports. In 2016, for example, U.S. imports exceeded exports by $502 billion.\nA series of financial crises triggered by unbalanced trade can lead economies into deep recessions. These crises begin with large trade deficits. At some point, foreign investors become pessimistic about the economy and move their money to other countries. The economy then drops into deep recession, with real GDP often falling up to 10% or more in a single year. This happened to Mexico in 1995 when their GDP fell 8.1%. A number of countries in East Asia—Thailand, South Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia—succumbed to the same economic illness in 1997–1998 (called the Asian Financial Crisis). In the late 1990s and into the early 2000s, Russia and Argentina had the identical experience. What are the connections between imbalances of trade in goods and services and the flows of international financial capital that set off these economic avalanches?\nWe will start by examining the balance of trade in more detail, by looking at some patterns of trade balances in the United States and around the world. Then we will examine the intimate connection between international flows of goods and services and international flows of financial capital, which to economists are really just two sides of the same coin. People often assume that trade surpluses like those in Germany must be a positive sign for an economy, while trade deficits like those in the United States must be harmful. As it turns out, both trade surpluses and deficits can be either good or bad. We will see why in this chapter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: We are all part of the global financial system, which includes many different currencies. (Credit: modification of work by epSos.de/Flickr Creative Commons)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMORE THAN MEETS THE EYE IN THE CONGO\nHow much do you interact with the global financial system? Do you think not much? Think again. Suppose you take out a student loan, or you deposit money into your bank account. You just affected domestic savings and borrowing. Now say you are at the mall and buy two T-shirts “made in China,” and later contribute to a charity that helps refugees. What is the impact? You affected how much money flows into and out of the United States. If you open an IRA savings account and put money in an international mutual fund, you are involved in the flow of money overseas. While your involvement may not seem as influential as that of someone like the president, who can increase or decrease foreign aid and, thereby, have a huge impact on money flows in and out of the country, you do interact with the global financial system on a daily basis.\nThe balance of payments—a term you will meet soon—seems like a huge topic, but once you learn the specific components of trade and money, it all makes sense. Along the way, you may have to give up some common misunderstandings about trade and answer some questions: If a country is running a trade deficit, is that bad? Is a trade surplus good? For example, look at the Democratic Republic of the Congo (often referred to as “Congo”), a large country in Central Africa. In 2013, it ran a trade surplus of $1 billion, so it must be doing well, right? In contrast, the trade deficit in the United States was $508 billion in 2013. Do these figures suggest that the United States economy is performing worse than the Congolese economy? Not necessarily. The U.S. trade deficit tends to worsen as the economy strengthens. In contrast, high poverty rates in the Congo persist, and these rates are not going down even with the positive trade balance. Clearly, it is more complicated than simply asserting that running a trade deficit is bad for the economy. You will learn more about these issues and others in this chapter.\n\n\nA few decades ago, it was common to track the solid or physical items that planes, trains, and trucks transported between countries as a way of measuring the balance of trade. Economists call this measurement is called the merchandise trade balance. In most high-income economies, including the United States, goods comprise less than half of a country’s total production, while services comprise more than half. The last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services, powered by technological advances in telecommunications and computers that have made it possible to export or import customer services, finance, law, advertising, management consulting, software, construction engineering, and product design. Most global trade still takes the form of goods rather than services, and the government announces and the media prominently report the merchandise trade balance. Old habits are hard to break. Economists, however, typically rely on broader measures such as the balance of trade or the current account balance which includes other international flows of income and foreign aid.\n\n6.6.1 Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance\nTable 6.15 breaks down the four main components of the U.S. current account balance for the last quarter of 2015 (seasonally adjusted). The first line shows the merchandise trade balance; that is, exports and imports of goods. Because imports exceed exports, the trade balance in the final column is negative, showing a merchandise trade deficit. We can explain how the government collects this trade information in the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\nTable 6.15: Components of the U.S. Current Account Balance for 2015 (in billions)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue of Exports (money\n| flowing into U.S.)\nValue of Imports (money\n| flowing out of U.S.)\nBa lance\n\n\n\n\nGoods\n$410.0\n$595.5\n–$ 185.3\n\n\nServices\n$180.4\n$122.3\n\n$58.1\n\n\nIncome receipts\nand payments\n$203.0\n$152.4\n\n$50.6\n\n\nUnilateral\ntransfers\n$27.3\n$64.4\n–\n$37.1\n\n\nCurrent account\nbalance\n$820.7\n$934.4\n–$ 113.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW DOES THE U.S. GOVERNMENT COLLECT TRADE STATISTICS?\nDo not confuse the balance of trade (which tracks imports and exports), with the current account balance, which includes not just exports and imports, but also income from investment and transfers.\nThe Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) within the U.S. Department of Commerce compiles statistics on the balance of trade using a variety of different sources. Merchandise importers and exporters must file monthly documents with the Census Bureau, which provides the basic data for tracking trade. To measure international trade in services—which can happen over a telephone line or computer network without shipping any physical goods—the BEA carries out a set of surveys. Another set of BEA surveys tracks investment flows, and there are even specific surveys to collect travel information from U.S. residents visiting Canada and Mexico. For measuring unilateral transfers, the BEA has access to official U.S. government spending on aid, and then also carries out a survey of charitable organizations that make foreign donations.\nThe BEA then cross-checks this information on international flows of goods and capital against other available data. For example, the Census Bureau also collects data from the shipping industry, which it can use to check the data on trade in goods. All companies involved in international flows of capital—including banks and companies making financial investments like stocks—must file reports, which the U.S. Department of the Treasury ultimately checks. The BEA also can cross check information on foreign trade by looking at data collected by other countries on their foreign trade with the United States, and also at the data collected by various international organizations. Take these data sources, stir carefully, and you have the U.S. balance of trade statistics. Much of the statistics that we cite in this chapter come from these sources.\n\n\nThe second row of Table 6.15 provides data on trade in services. Here, the U.S. economy is running a surplus. Although the level of trade in services is still relatively small compared to trade in goods, the importance of services has expanded substantially over the last few decades. For example, U.S. exports of services were equal to about one-half of U.S. exports of goods in 2015, compared to one-fifth in 1980.\nThe third component of the current account balance, labeled “income payments,” refers to money that U.S. financial investors received on their foreign investments (money flowing into the United States) and payments to foreign investors who had invested their funds here (money flowing out of the United States). The reason for including this money on foreign investment in the overall measure of trade, along with goods and services, is that, from an economic perspective, income is just as much an economic transaction as car, wheat, or oil shipments: it is just trade that is happening in the financial capital market.\nThe final category of the current account balance is unilateral transfers, which are payments that government, private charities, or individuals make in which they send money abroad without receiving any direct good or service. Economic or military assistance from the U.S. government to other countries fits into this category, as does spending abroad by charities to address poverty or social inequalities. When an individual in the United States sends money overseas, as is the case with some immigrants, it is also counted in this category. The current account balance treats these unilateral payments like imports, because they also involve a stream of payments leaving the country. For the U.S. economy, unilateral transfers are almost always negative. This pattern, however, does not always hold. In 1991, for example, when the United States led an international coalition against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq in the Gulf War, many other nations agreed that they would make payments to the United States to offset the U.S. war expenses. These payments were large enough that, in 1991, the overall U.S. balance on unilateral transfers was a positive $10 billion.\nThe following Work It Out feature steps you through the process of using the values for goods, services, and income payments to calculate the merchandise balance and the current account balance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCALCULATING THE MERCHANDISE BALANCE AND THE CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE\n\n\n\nTable 6.16: Calculating Merchandise Balance and Current Account Balance\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\nExports (in $ billions)\nImports (in $ billions)\nBalance\n\n\n\n\nGoods Services Income payments Unilateral transfers Current account balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the information given below to fill in Table 6.16, and then calculate:\n\n\nThe merchandise balance\nThe current account balance\n\n\nKnown information:\n\n\nUnilateral transfers: $130\nExports in goods: $1,046\nExports in services: $509\nImports in goods: $1,562\nImports in services: $371\nIncome received by U.S. investors on foreign stocks and bonds: $561\nIncome received by foreign investors on U.S. assets: $472\n\n\nStep 1.\n\nFocus on goods and services first. Enter the dollar amount of exports of both goods and services under the Export column.\n\nStep 2.\n\nEnter imports of goods and services under the Import column.\n\nStep 3.\n\nUnder the Export column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money coming back to the United States. U.S. investors are earning this income from abroad.\n\nStep 4.\n\nUnder the Import column and in the row for Income payments, enter the financial flows of money going out of the United States to foreign investors. Foreign investors are earning this money on U.S. assets, like stocks.\n\nStep 5.\n\nUnilateral transfers are money flowing out of the United States in the form of, for example, military aid, foreign aid, and global charities. Because the money leaves the country, enter it under Imports and in the final column as well, as a negative.\n\nStep 6.\n\nCalculate the trade balance by subtracting imports from exports in both goods and services. Enter this in the final Balance column. This can be positive or negative.\n\nStep 7.\n\nSubtract the income payments flowing out of the country (under Imports) from the money coming back to the United States (under Exports) and enter this amount under the Balance column.\n\nStep 8.\n\nEnter unilateral transfers as a negative amount under the Balance column.\n\nStep 9.\n\nThe merchandise trade balance is the difference between exports of goods and imports of goods—the first number under Balance.\n\nStep 10.\n\nNow sum up your columns for Exports, Imports, and Balance. The final balance number is the current account balance.\n\n\nThe merchandise balance of trade is the difference between exports and imports. In this case, it is equal to $1,046 – $1,562, a trade deficit of –$516 billion. The current account balance is –$419 billion. See the completed Table 6.17.\n\n\n\nTable 6.17: Completed Merchandise Balance and Current Account Balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValue of Exports (money flowing into U.S.)\nValue of Imports (money flowing out of U.S.)\nBa lance\n\n\n\n\nGoods\n$1,510.3\n$2,272.9\n–$ 762.6\n\n\nServices\n$750.9\n$488.7\n$ 262.2\n\n\nIncome receipts\nand payments\n$782.9\n$600.5\n$ 182.4\n\n\nUnilateral\ntransfers\n$128.6\n$273.6\n–$ 145.0\n\n\nCurrent account\nbalance\n$3,172.7\n$3,635.7\n–$ 463.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe trade balance measures the gap between a country’s exports and its imports.\nIn most high-income economies, goods comprise less than half of a country’s total production, while services comprise more than half.\nThe last two decades have seen a surge in international trade in services; however, most global trade still takes the form of goods rather than services.\nThe current account balance includes the trade in goods, services, and money flowing into and out of a country from investments and unilateral transfers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf foreign investors buy more U.S. stocks and bonds, how would that show up in the current account balance?\nIf the trade deficit of the United States increases, how is the current account balance affected?\nState whether each of the following events involves a financial flow to the Mexican economy or a financial flow out of the Mexican economy:\n: a. Mexico imports services from Japan b. Mexico exports goods to Canada c. U.S. investors receive a return from past financial investments in Mexico\nIf imports exceed exports, is it a trade deficit or a trade surplus? What about if exports exceed imports?\nWhat is included in the current account balance?\nOccasionally, a government official will argue that a country should strive for both a trade surplus and a healthy inflow of capital from abroad. Explain why such a statement is economically impossible.\nA government official announces a new policy. The country wishes to eliminate its trade deficit, but will strongly encourage financial investment from foreign firms. Explain why such a statement is contradictory.",

In Figure 6.9 we show the trade balance as percent of GDP. The trade balance is the difference between exports and imports. Finally, in Figure 6.10 we show the current account balance in billions of USD.\nWe present the history of the U.S. current account balance in recent decades in several different ways. Figure 6.11 (a) shows the current account balance and the merchandise trade balance in dollar terms. Figure 6.11 (b) shows the current account balance and merchandise account balance yet again, this time as a share of the GDP for that year. By dividing the trade deficit in each year by GDP in that year, Figure 6.11 (b) factors out both inflation and growth in the real economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Panel (a) The current account balance and the merchandise trade balance in billions of dollars from 1960 to 2015. If the lines are above zero dollars, the United States was running a positive trade balance and current account balance. If the lines fall below zero dollars, the United States is running a trade deficit and a deficit in its current account balance. (b) This shows the same items—trade balance and current account balance—in relationship to the size of the U.S. economy, or GDP, from 1960 to 2015.\n\n\n\nBy either measure, the U.S. balance of trade pattern is clear. From the 1960s into the 1970s, the U.S. economy had mostly small trade surpluses—that is, the graphs in Figure show positive numbers. However, starting in the 1980s, the trade deficit increased rapidly, and after a tiny surplus in 1991, the current account trade deficit became even larger in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s. However, the trade deficit declined in 2009 after the recession had taken hold, then rebounded partially in 2010 and has remained stable up through 2016.\nTable 6.18 shows the U.S. trade picture in 2013 compared with some other economies from around the world. While the U.S. economy has consistently run trade deficits in recent years, Japan and many European nations, among them France and Germany, have consistently run trade surpluses. Some of the other countries listed include Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America; Nigeria, along with South Africa competing to be the largest economy in Africa; and China, India, and Korea.\nThe first column offers one measure of an economy's globalization: exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP. The second column shows the trade balance. Usually, most countries have trade surpluses or deficits that are less than 5% of GDP. As you can see, the U.S. current account balance is –2.6% of GDP, while Germany's is 8.4% of GDP.\n\n\n\nTable 6.18: Level and Balance of Trade in 2015 (figures as a percentage of GDP, Source: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BN.CAB.XOKA.GD.ZS)\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nExports of Goods and Services\nCurrent Account Balance\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n17.6%\n–2.6%\n\n\nJapan\n16.2%\n3.1%\n\n\nGermany\n46.8%\n8.4%\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n27.2%\n–5.4%\n\n\nCanada\n31.5%\n–3.2%\n\n\nSweden\n45.6%\n5.2%\n\n\nKorea\n45.9%\n7.7%\n\n\nMexico\n35.4%\n–2.9%\n\n\nBrazil\n13.0%\n–3.3%\n\n\nChina\n22.1%\n3.0%\n\n\nIndia\n19.9%\n–1.1%\n\n\nNigeria\n10.7%\n-3.3%\n\n\nWorld\n-\n0.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe United States developed large trade surpluses in the early 1980s, swung back to a tiny trade surplus in 1991, and then had even larger trade deficits in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nAs we will see below, a trade deficit necessarily means a net inflow of financial capital from abroad, while a trade surplus necessarily means a net outflow of financial capital from an economy to other countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn what way does comparing a country’s exports to GDP reflect its degree of globalization?\nAt one point Canada’s GDP was $1,800 billion and its exports were $542 billion.

    "text": "6.8 Trade Balances and Flows of Financial Capital\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the connection between trade balances and financial capital flows\nCalculate comparative advantage\nExplain balanced trade in terms of investment and capital flows\n\n\n\nAs economists see it, trade surpluses can be either good or bad, depending on circumstances, and trade deficits can be good or bad, too. The challenge is to understand how the international flows of goods and services are connected with international flows of financial capital. In this module we will illustrate the intimate connection between trade balances and flows of financial capital in two ways: a parable of trade between Robinson Crusoe and Friday, and a circular flow diagram representing flows of trade and payme\n\n6.8.1 A Two-Person Economy: Robinson Crusoe and Friday\nTo understand how economists view trade deficits and surpluses, consider a parable based on the story of Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe, as you may remember from the classic novel by Daniel Defoe first published in 1719, was shipwrecked on a desert island. After living alone for some time, he is joined by a second person, whom he names Friday. Think about the balance of trade in a two-person economy like that of Robinson and Friday.\nRobinson and Friday trade goods and services. Perhaps Robinson catches fish and trades them to Friday for coconuts, or Friday weaves a hat out of tree fronds and trades it to Robinson for help in carrying water. For a period of time, each individual trade is self-contained and complete. Because each trade is voluntary, both Robinson and Friday must feel that they are receiving fair value for what they are giving. As a result, each person’s exports are always equal to his imports, and trade is always in balance between the two. Neither person experiences either a trade deficit or a trade surplus.\nHowever, one day Robinson approaches Friday with a proposition. Robinson wants to dig ditches for an irrigation system for his garden, but he knows that if he starts this project, he will not have much time left to fish and gather coconuts to feed himself each day. He proposes that Friday supply him with a certain number of fish and coconuts for several months, and then after that time, he promises to repay Friday out of the extra produce that he will be able to grow in his irrigated garden. If Friday accepts this offer, then a trade imbalance comes into being. For several months, Friday will have a trade surplus: that is, he is exporting to Robinson more than he is importing. More precisely, he is giving Robinson fish and coconuts, and at least for the moment, he is receiving nothing in return. Conversely, Robinson will have a trade deficit, because he is importing more from Friday than he is exporting.\nThis parable raises several useful issues in thinking about what a trade deficit and a trade surplus really mean in economic terms. The first issue that this story of Robinson and Friday raises is this: Is it better to have a trade surplus or a trade deficit? The answer, as in any voluntary market interaction, is that if both parties agree to the transaction, then they may both be better off. Over time, if Robinson’s irrigated garden is a success, it is certainly possible that both Robinson and Friday can benefit from this agreement.\nThe parable raises a second issue: What can go wrong? Robinson’s proposal to Friday introduces an element of uncertainty. Friday is, in effect, making a loan of fish and coconuts to Robinson, and Friday’s happiness with this arrangement will depend on whether Robinson repays that loan as planned, in full and on time. Perhaps Robinson spends several months loafing and never builds the irrigation system, or perhaps Robinson has been too optimistic about how much he will be able to grow with the new irrigation system, which turns out not to be very productive. Perhaps, after building the irrigation system, Robinson decides that he does not want to repay Friday as much as he previously agreed. Any of these developments will prompt a new round of negotiations between Friday and Robinson. Why the repayment failed is likely to shape Friday’s attitude toward these renegotiations. If Robinson worked very hard and the irrigation system just did not increase production as intended, Friday may have some sympathy. If Robinson loafed or if he just refuses to pay, Friday may become irritated.\nA third issue that the parable raises is that an intimate relationship exists between a trade deficit and international borrowing, and between a trade surplus and international lending. The size of Friday’s trade surplus is exactly how much he is lending to Robinson. The size of Robinson’s trade deficit is exactly how much he is borrowing from Friday. To economists, a trade surplus literally means the same thing as an outflow of financial capital, and a trade deficit literally means the same thing as an inflow of financial capital. This last insight is worth exploring in greater detail, which we will do in the following section.\nThe story of Robinson and Friday also provides a good opportunity to consider the law of comparative advantage, which you learn more about in the International Trade chapter. The following Work It Out feature steps you through calculating comparative advantage for the wheat and cloth traded between the United States and Great Britain in the 1800s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCALCULATING COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE\nIn the 1800s, the United States and Britain traded wheat and cloth. Table 6.19 shows the varying hours of labor per unit of output.\n\n\n\nTable 6.19: U.S. and Britain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nWheat (in bushels)\nCloth (in yards)\nRelative labor cost of wheat \\(\\frac{P_w}{P_c}\\)\nRelative labor cost of cloth \\(\\frac{P_c}{P_w}\\)\n\n\nU.S.\n8\n9\n8/9\n9/8\n\n\nBritain\n4\n3\n4/3\n3/4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.\n\nObserve from Table that, in the United States, it takes eight hours to supply a bushel of wheat and nine hours to supply a yard of cloth. In contrast, it takes four hours to supply a bushel of wheat and three hours to supply a yard of cloth in Britain.\n\nStep 2.\n\nRecognize the difference between absolute advantage and comparative advantage. Britain has an absolute advantage (lowest cost) in each good, since it takes a lower amount of labor to make each good in Britain. Britain also has a comparative advantage in the production of cloth (lower opportunity cost in cloth (3/4 versus 9/8)). The United States has a comparative advantage in wheat production (lower opportunity cost of 8/9 versus 4/3).\n\nStep 3.\n\nDetermine the relative price of one good in terms of the other good. The price of wheat, in this example, is the amount of cloth you have to give up. To find this price, convert the hours per unit of wheat and cloth into units per hour. To do so, observe that in the United States it takes eight hours to make a bushel of wheat, so workers can process 1/8 of a bushel of wheat in an hour. It takes nine hours to make a yard of cloth in the United States, so workers can produce 1/9 of a yard of cloth in an hour. If you divide the amount of cloth (1/9 of a yard) by the amount of wheat you give up (1/8 of a bushel) in an hour, you find the price (8/9) of one good (wheat) in terms of the other (cloth).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.8.2 The Balance of Trade as the Balance of Payments\nThe connection between trade balances and international flows of financial capital is so close that economists sometimes describe the balance of trade as the balance of payments. Each category of the current account balance involves a corresponding flow of payments between a given country and the rest of the world economy.\nFigure 6.12 shows the flow of goods and services and payments between one country—the United States in this example—and the rest of the world. The top line shows U.S. exports of goods and services, while the second line shows financial payments from purchasers in other countries back to the U.S. economy. The third line then shows U.S. imports of goods, services, and investment, and the fourth line shows payments from the home economy to the rest of the world. Flow of goods and services (lines one and three) show up in the current account, while we find flow of funds (lines two and four) in the financial account.\nThe bottom four lines in Figure 6.12 show the flows of investment income. In the first of the bottom lines, we see investments made abroad with funds flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. Investment income stemming from an investment abroad then runs in the other direction from the rest of the world to the home country. Similarly, we see on the bottom third line, an investment from the rest of the world into the home country and investment income (bottom fourth line) flowing from the home country to the rest of the world. We find the investment income (bottom lines two and four) in the current account, while investment to the rest of the world or into the home country (lines one and three) is in the financial account. This figure does not show unilateral transfers, the fourth item in the current account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Flow of Investment Goods and Capital. Each element of the current account balance involves a flow of financial payments between countries. The top line shows exports of goods and services leaving the home country; the second line shows the money that the home country receives for those exports. The third line shows imports that the home country receives; the fourth line shows the payments that the home country sent abroad in exchange for these imports.\n\n\n\nThe illustration shows relationships and transactions between a home country (box on the left) and the rest of the world (box on the right). The home country will provide exports, payment for imports, foreign investment, and investment income paid to the rest of the world. The rest of the world will provide payment for exports, imports, investment income received, and investment from abroad to the home country.\nA current account deficit means that, the country is a net borrower from abroad. Conversely, a positive current account balance means a country is a net lender to the rest of the world. Just like the parable of Robinson and Friday, the lesson is that a trade surplus means an overall outflow of financial investment capital, as domestic investors put their funds abroad, while a deficit in the current account balance is exactly equal to the overall or net inflow of foreign investment capital from abroad.\nIt is important to recognize that an inflow and outflow of foreign capital does not necessarily refer to a debt that governments owe to other governments, although government debt may be part of the picture. Instead, these international flows of financial capital refer to all of the ways in which private investors in one country may invest in another country—by buying real estate, companies, and financial investments like stocks and bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nInternational flows of goods and services are closely connected to the international flows of financial capital.\nA current account deficit means that, after taking all the flows of payments from goods, services, and income together, the country is a net borrower from the rest of the world.\nA current account surplus is the opposite and means the country is a net lender to the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\nState whether each of the following events involves a financial flow to the U.S. economy or away from the U.S. economy:\n\n:   a.  Export sales to Germany\n    b.  Returns paid on past U.S. financial investments in Brazil\n    c.  Foreign aid from the U.S. government to Egypt\n    d.  Imported oil from the Russian Federation\n    e.  Japanese investors buying U.S. real estate\n\nHow does the bottom portion of Figure, showing the international flow of investments and capital, differ from the upper portion?\nExplain the relationship between a current account deficit or surplus and the flow of funds.\nDoes a trade surplus mean an overall inflow of financial capital to an economy, or an overall outflow of financial capital? What about a trade deficit?\nIs it better for your country to be an international lender or borrower?",

    "text": "6.9 The National Saving and Investment Identity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the determinants of trade and current account balance\nIdentify and calculate supply and demand for financial capital\nExplain how a nation's own level of domestic saving and investment determines a nation's balance of trade\nPredict the rising and falling of trade deficits based on a nation's saving and investment identity\n\n\n\nThe close connection between trade balances and international flows of savings and investments leads to a macroeconomic analysis. This approach views trade balances—and their associated flows of financial capital—in the context of the overall levels of savings and financial investment in the economy.\n\n6.9.1 Understanding the Determinants of the Trade and Current Account Balance\nThe national saving and investment identity provides a useful way to understand the determinants of the trade and current account balance. In a nation’s financial capital market, the quantity of financial capital supplied at any given time must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded for purposes of making investments. What is on the supply and demand sides of financial capital? See the following Clear It Up feature for the answer to this question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT COMPRISES THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF FINANCIAL CAPITAL?\nA country’s national savings is the total of its domestic savings by household and companies (private savings) as well as the government (public savings). If a country is running a trade deficit, it means money from abroad is entering the country and the government considers it part of the supply of financial capital.\nThe demand for financial capital (money) represents groups that are borrowing the money. Businesses need to borrow to finance their investments in factories, materials, and personnel. When the federal government runs a budget deficit, it is also borrowing money from investors by selling Treasury bonds. Therefore, both business investment and the federal government can demand (or borrow) the supply of savings.\n\n\nThere are two main sources for the supply of financial capital in the U.S. economy: saving by individuals and firms, called S, and the inflow of financial capital from foreign investors, which is equal to the trade deficit (M – X), or imports minus exports. There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital in the U.S. economy: private sector investment, I, and government borrowing, where the government needs to borrow when government spending, G, is higher than the taxes collected, T. We can express this national savings and investment identity in algebraic terms:\n\\[\\text{Supply of financial capital} = \\text{Demand for financial capital}\\]\n\\[S + (M – X) = I + (G – T)\\]\nAgain, in this equation, S is private savings, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment. This relationship is true as a matter of definition because, for the macro economy, the quantity supplied of financial capital must be equal to the quantity demanded.\nHowever, certain components of the national savings and investment identity can switch between the supply side and the demand side. Some countries, like the United States in most years since the 1970s, have budget deficits, which mean the government is spending more than it collects in taxes, and so the government needs to borrow funds. In this case, the government term would be G – T &gt; 0, showing that spending is larger than taxes, and the government would be a demander of financial capital on the left-hand side of the equation (that is, a borrower), not a supplier of financial capital on the right-hand side. However, if the government runs a budget surplus so that the taxes exceed spending, as the U.S. government did from 1998 to 2001, then the government in that year was contributing to the supply of financial capital (T – G &gt; 0), and would appear on the left (saving) side of the national savings and investment identity.\nSimilarly, if a national economy runs a trade surplus, the trade sector will involve an outflow of financial capital to other countries. A trade surplus means that the domestic financial capital is in surplus within a country and can be invested in other countries.\nThe fundamental notion that total quantity of financial capital demanded equals total quantity of financial capital supplied must always remain true. Domestic savings will always appear as part of the supply of financial capital and domestic investment will always appear as part of the demand for financial capital. However, the government and trade balance elements of the equation can move back and forth as either suppliers or demanders of financial capital, depending on whether government budgets and the trade balance are in surplus or deficit.\n\n\n6.9.2 Domestic Saving and Investment Determine the Trade Balance\nOne insight from the national saving and investment identity is that a nation's own levels of domestic saving and investment determine a nation’s balance of trade. To understand this point, rearrange the identity to put the balance of trade all by itself on one side of the equation. Consider first the situation with a trade deficit, and then the situation with a trade surplus.\nIn the case of a trade deficit, the national saving and investment identity can be rewritten as:\n\\[\\text{Trade deficit} = \\text{Domestic investment} – \\text{Private domestic saving} – \\text{Government (or public) savings}\\]\n\\[(M – X) = I – S – (T – G)\\]\nIn this case, domestic investment is higher than domestic saving, including both private and government saving. The only way that domestic investment can exceed domestic saving is if capital is flowing into a country from abroad. After all, that extra financial capital for investment has to come from someplace.\nNow consider a trade surplus from the standpoint of the national saving and investment identity:\n\\[\\text{Trade surplus} = \\text{Private domestic saving} + \\text{Public saving} – \\text{Domestic investment}\\]\n\\[(X – M) = S + (T – G) – I\\]\nIn this case, domestic savings (both private and public) is higher than domestic investment. That extra financial capital will be invested abroad.\nThis connection of domestic saving and investment to the trade balance explains why economists view the balance of trade as a fundamentally macroeconomic phenomenon. As the national saving and investment identity shows, the performance of certain sectors of an economy, like cars or steel, do not determine the trade balance. Further, whether the nation’s trade laws and regulations encourage free trade or protectionism also does not determine the trade balance (see Globalization and Protectionism).\n\n\n6.9.3 Exploring Trade Balances One Factor at a Time\nThe national saving and investment identity also provides a framework for thinking about what will cause trade deficits to rise or fall. Begin with the version of the identity that has domestic savings and investment on the left and the trade deficit on the right:\n\\[\\text{Domestic investment} – \\text{Private domestic savings} – \\text{Public domestic savings}  = \\text{Trade deficit}\\]\n\\[I – S – (T – G) = (M – X)\\]\nNow, consider the factors on the left-hand side of the equation one at a time, while holding the other factors constant.\nAs a first example, assume that the level of domestic investment in a country rises, while the level of private and public saving remains unchanged. Table 6.20 shows the result in the first row under the equation. Since the equality of the national savings and investment identity must continue to hold—it is, after all, an identity that must be true by definition—the rise in domestic investment will mean a higher trade deficit. This situation occurred in the U.S. economy in the late 1990s. Because of the surge of new information and communications technologies that became available, business investment increased substantially. A fall in private saving during this time and a rise in government saving more or less offset each other. As a result, the financial capital to fund that business investment came from abroad, which is one reason for the very high U.S. trade deficits of the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\\[\\text{Domestic Investment}  –   \\text{Private Domestic Savings}   – \\text{Public Domestic Savings}    = \\text{Trade Deficit}\\]\n\n\n\nTable 6.20: Causes of a Changing Trade Balance\n\n\n\n\n\nI\n– S\n– (T – G)\n= (M – X)\n\n\n\n\nUp\nNo change\nNo change\nThen M – X must rise\n\n\nNo change\nUp\nNo change\nThen M – X must fall\n\n\nNo change\nNo change\nDown\nThen M – X must rise\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a second scenario, assume that the level of domestic savings rises, while the level of domestic investment and public savings remain unchanged. In this case, the trade deficit would decline. As domestic savings rises, there would be less need for foreign financial capital to meet investment needs. For this reason, a policy proposal often made for reducing the U.S. trade deficit is to increase private saving—although exactly how to increase the overall rate of saving has proven controversial.\nAs a third scenario, imagine that the government budget deficit increased dramatically, while domestic investment and private savings remained unchanged. This scenario occurred in the U.S. economy in the mid-1980s. The federal budget deficit increased from $79 billion in 1981 to $221 billion in 1986—an increase in the demand for financial capital of $142 billion. The current account balance collapsed from a surplus of $5 billion in 1981 to a deficit of $147 billion in 1986—an increase in the supply of financial capital from abroad of $152 billion. The connection at that time is clear: a sharp increase in government borrowing increased the U.S. economy’s demand for financial capital, and foreign investors through the trade deficit primarily supplied that increase. The following Work It Out feature walks you through a scenario in which private domestic savings has to rise by a certain amount to reduce a trade deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSOLVING PROBLEMS WITH THE SAVING AND INVESTMENT IDENTITY\nUse the saving and investment identity to answer the following question: Country A has a trade deficit of $200 billion, private domestic savings of $500 billion, a government deficit of $200 billion, and private domestic investment of $500 billion. To reduce the $200 billion trade deficit by $100 billion, by how much does private domestic savings have to increase?\n\nStep 1.\n\nWrite out the savings investment formula solving for the trade deficit or surplus on the left:\n\n\n\\[(X – M) = S + (T – G) – I\\]\n\nStep 2.\n\nIn the formula, put the amount for the trade deficit in as a negative number (X – M). The left side of your formula is now:\n\n\n\\[–200 = S + (T – G) – I\\]\n\nStep 3.\n\nEnter the private domestic savings (S) of $500 in the formula:\n\n\n\\[–200 = 500 + (T – G) – I\\]\n\nStep 4.\n\nEnter the private domestic investment (I) of $500 into the formula:\n\n\n\\[–200=500+ (T – G) – 500\\]\n\nStep 5.\n\nThe government budget surplus or balance is represented by (T – G). Enter a budget deficit amount for (T – G) of –200:\n\n\n\\[–200 = 500 + (–200) – 500\\]\n\nStep 6.\n\nYour formula now is:\n\n\n\\[(X – M) = S + (T – G) – I\\]\n\\[–200 = 500 + (–200) – 500\\]\nThe question is: To reduce your trade deficit (X – M) of –200 to –100 (in billions of dollars), by how much will savings have to rise?\n\\[(X – M) = S + (T – G) – I\\]\n\\[–100 = S + (–200) – 500\\]\n\\[S = 600\\]\n\nStep 7.\n\nSummarize the answer: Private domestic savings needs to rise by $100 billion, to a total of $600 billion, for the two sides of the equation to remain equal (–100 = –100).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.9.4 Short-Term Movements in the Business Cycle and the Trade Balance\nIn the short run, whether an economy is in a recession or on the upswing can affect trade imbalances. A recession tends to make a trade deficit smaller, or a trade surplus larger, while a period of strong economic growth tends to make a trade deficit larger, or a trade surplus smaller.\nAs an example, note in [link] that the U.S. trade deficit declined by almost half from 2006 to 2009. One primary reason for this change is that during the recession, as the U.S. economy slowed down, it purchased fewer of all goods, including fewer imports from abroad. However, buying power abroad fell less, and so U.S. exports did not fall by as much.\nConversely, in the mid-2000s, when the U.S. trade deficit became very large, a contributing short-term reason is that the U.S. economy was growing. As a result, there was considerable aggressive buying in the U.S. economy, including the buying of imports. Thus, a trade deficit (or a much lower trade surplus) often accompanies a rapidly growing domestic economy, while a trade surplus (or a much lower trade deficit) accompanies a slowing or recessionary domestic economy.\nWhen the trade deficit rises, it necessarily means a greater net inflow of foreign financial capital. The national saving and investment identity teaches that the rest of the economy can absorb this inflow of foreign financial capital in several different ways. For example, reduced private savings could offset the additional inflow of financial capital from abroad, leaving domestic investment and public saving unchanged. Alternatively, the inflow of foreign financial capital could result in higher domestic investment, leaving private and public saving unchanged. Yet another possibility is that greater government borrowing could absorb the inflow of foreign financial capital, leaving domestic saving and investment unchanged. The national saving and investment identity does not specify which of these scenarios, alone or in combination, will occur—only that one of them must occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe national saving and investment identity is based on the relationship that the total quantity of financial capital supplied from all sources must equal the total quantity of financial capital demanded from all sources. If S is private saving, T is taxes, G is government spending, M is imports, X is exports, and I is investment, then for an economy with a current account deficit and a budget deficit:\n\n\\[\\text{Supply of financial capital} = \\text{Demand for financial capital}\\]\n\\[S +  (M – X)=I +  (G – T)\\]\n\nA recession tends to increase the trade balance (meaning a higher trade surplus or lower trade deficit), while economic boom will tend to decrease the trade balance (meaning a lower trade surplus or a larger trade deficit).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a country is running a government budget surplus, why is (T – G) on the left side of the saving-investment identity?\nWhat determines the size of a country’s trade deficit?\nIf domestic investment increases, and there is no change in the amount of private and public saving, what must happen to the size of the trade deficit?\nWhy does a recession cause a trade deficit to increase?\nBoth the United States and global economies are booming. Will U.S. imports and/or exports increase?\nWhat are the two main sides of the national savings and investment identity?\nWhat are the main components of the national savings and investment identity?\nMany think that the size of a trade deficit is due to a lack of competitiveness of domestic sectors, such as autos. Explain why this is not true.\nIf you observed a country with a rapidly growing trade surplus over a period of a year or so, would you be more likely to believe that the country's economy was in a period of recession or of rapid growth? Explain.\nOccasionally, a government official will argue that a country should strive for both a trade surplus and a healthy inflow of capital from abroad. Is this possible?",

    "text": "6.10 The Pros and Cons of Trade Deficits and Surpluses\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nIdentify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a healthy economy\nIdentify three ways in which borrowing money or running a trade deficit can result in a weaker economy\n\n\n\nBecause flows of trade always involve flows of financial payments, flows of international trade are actually the same as flows of international financial capital. The question of whether trade deficits or surpluses are good or bad for an economy is, in economic terms, exactly the same question as whether it is a good idea for an economy to rely on net inflows of financial capital from abroad or to make net investments of financial capital abroad. Conventional wisdom often holds that borrowing money is foolhardy, and that a prudent country, like a prudent person, should always rely on its own resources. While it is certainly possible to borrow too much—as anyone with an overloaded credit card can testify—borrowing at certain times can also make sound economic sense. For both individuals and countries, there is no economic merit in a policy of abstaining from participation in financial capital markets.\nIt makes economic sense to borrow when you are buying something with a long-run payoff; that is, when you are making an investment. For this reason, it can make economic sense to borrow for a college education, because the education will typically allow you to earn higher wages, and so to repay the loan and still come out ahead. It can also make sense for a business to borrow in order to purchase a machine that will last 10 years, as long as the machine will increase output and profits by more than enough to repay the loan. Similarly, it can make economic sense for a national economy to borrow from abroad, as long as it wisely invests the money in ways that will tend to raise the nation’s economic growth over time. Then, it will be possible for the national economy to repay the borrowed money over time and still end up better off than before.\nOne vivid example of a country that borrowed heavily from abroad, invested wisely, and did perfectly well is the United States during the nineteenth century. The United States ran a trade deficit in 40 of the 45 years from 1831 to 1875, which meant that it was importing capital from abroad over that time. However, that financial capital was mostly invested in projects like railroads that brought a substantial economic payoff. (See the following Clear It Up feature for more on this.)\nA more recent example along these lines is the experience of South Korea, which had trade deficits during much of the 1970s—and so was an importer of capital over that time. However, South Korea also had high rates of investment in physical plant and equipment, and its economy grew rapidly. From the mid-1980s into the mid-1990s, South Korea often had trade surpluses—that is, it was repaying its past borrowing by sending capital abroad.\nIn contrast, some countries have run large trade deficits, borrowed heavily in global capital markets, and ended up in all kinds of trouble. Two specific sorts of trouble are worth examining. First, a borrower nation can find itself in a bind if it does not invest the incoming funds from abroad in a way that leads to increased productivity. Several of Latin America's large economies, including Mexico and Brazil, ran large trade deficits and borrowed heavily from abroad in the 1970s, but the inflow of financial capital did not boost productivity sufficiently, which meant that these countries faced enormous troubles repaying the money borrowed when economic conditions shifted during the 1980s. Similarly, it appears that a number of African nations that borrowed foreign funds in the 1970s and 1980s did not invest in productive economic assets. As a result, several of those countries later faced large interest payments, with no economic growth to show for the borrowed funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nARE TRADE DEFICITS ALWAYS HARMFUL?\nFor most years of the nineteenth century, U.S. imports exceeded exports and the U.S. economy had a trade deficit. Yet the string of trade deficits did not hold back the economy at all. Instead, the trade deficits contributed to the strong economic growth that gave the U.S. economy the highest per capita GDP in the world by around 1900.\nThe U.S. trade deficits meant that the U.S. economy was receiving a net inflow of foreign capital from abroad. Much of that foreign capital flowed into two areas of investment—railroads and public infrastructure like roads, water systems, and schools—which were important to helping the U.S. economy grow.\nWe should not overstate the effect of foreign investment capital on U.S. economic growth. In most years the foreign financial capital represented no more than 6–10% of the funds that the government used for overall physical investment in the economy. Nonetheless, the trade deficit and the accompanying investment funds from abroad were clearly a help, not a hindrance, to the U.S. economy in the nineteenth century.\n\n\nA second “trouble” is: What happens if the foreign money flows in, and then suddenly flows out again? We raised this scenario at the start of the chapter. In the mid-1990s, a number of countries in East Asia—Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea—ran large trade deficits and imported capital from abroad. However, in 1997 and 1998 many foreign investors became concerned about the health of these economies, and quickly pulled their money out of stock and bond markets, real estate, and banks. The extremely rapid departure of that foreign capital staggered the banking systems and economies of these countries, plunging them into deep recession. We investigate and discuss the links between international capital flows, banks, and recession in The Impacts of Government Borrowing.\nWhile a trade deficit is not always harmful, there is no guarantee that running a trade surplus will bring robust economic health. For example, Germany and Japan ran substantial trade surpluses for most of the last three decades. Regardless of their persistent trade surpluses, both countries have experienced occasional recessions and neither country has had especially robust annual growth in recent years. Read more about Japan’s trade surplus in the next Clear It Up feature.\nThe sheer size and persistence of the U.S. trade deficits and inflows of foreign capital since the 1980s are a legitimate cause for concern. The huge U.S. economy will not be destabilized by an outflow of international capital as easily as, say, the comparatively tiny economies of Thailand and Indonesia were in 1997–1998. Even an economy that is not knocked down, however, can still be shaken. American policymakers should certainly be paying attention to those cases where a pattern of extensive and sustained current account deficits and foreign borrowing has gone badly—if only as a cautionary tale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nARE TRADE SURPLUSES ALWAYS BENEFICIAL? CONSIDERING JAPAN SINCE THE 1990S.\nPerhaps no economy around the world is better known for its trade surpluses than Japan. Since 1990, the size of these surpluses has often been near $100 billion per year. When Japan’s economy was growing vigorously in the 1960s and 1970s, many, especially non-economists, described its large trade surpluses either a cause or a result of its robust economic health. However, from a standpoint of economic growth, Japan’s economy has been teetering in and out of recession since 1990, with real GDP growth averaging only about 1% per year, and an unemployment rate that has been creeping higher. Clearly, a whopping trade surplus is no guarantee of economic good health.\nInstead, Japan’s trade surplus reflects that Japan has a very high rate of domestic savings, more than the Japanese economy can invest domestically, and so it invests the extra funds abroad. In Japan’s slow economy, consumption of imports is relatively low, and the growth of consumption is relatively slow. Thus, Japan’s exports continually exceed its imports, leaving the trade surplus continually high. Recently, Japan’s trade surpluses began to deteriorate. In 2013, Japan ran a trade deficit due to the high cost of imported oil. By 2015, Japan again had a surplus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nTrade surpluses are no guarantee of economic health, and trade deficits are no guarantee of economic weakness.\nEither trade deficits or trade surpluses can work out well or poorly, depending on whether a government wisely invests the corresponding flows of financial capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did large trade deficits hurt the East Asian countries in the mid 1980s? (Recall that trade deficits are equivalent to inflows of financial capital from abroad.)\nDescribe a scenario in which a trade surplus benefits an economy and one in which a trade surplus is occurring in an economy that performs poorly. What key factor or factors are making the difference in the outcome that results from a trade surplus?\nWhen is a trade deficit likely to work out well for an economy? When is it likely to work out poorly?\nDoes a trade surplus help to guarantee strong economic growth?\nWhat is more important, a country’s current account balance or GDP growth? Why?",

    "text": "6.11 The Difference between Level of Trade and the Trade Balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nIdentify three factors that influence a country's level of trade\nDifferentiate between balance of trade and level of trade\n\n\n\nA nation’s level of trade may at first sound like much the same issue as the balance of trade, but these two are actually quite separate. It is perfectly possible for a country to have a very high level of trade—measured by its exports of goods and services as a share of its GDP—while it also has a near-balance between exports and imports. A high level of trade indicates that the nation exports a good portion of its production. It is also possible for a country’s trade to be a relatively low share of GDP, relative to global averages, but for the imbalance between its exports and its imports to be quite large. We emphasized this general theme earlier in Measuring Trade Balances, which offered some illustrative figures on trade levels and balances.\nA country’s level of trade tells how much of its production it exports. We measure this by the percent of exports out of GDP. It indicates the degree of an economy's globalization. Some countries, such as Germany, have a high level of trade—they export almost 50% of their total production. The balance of trade tells us if the country is running a trade surplus or trade deficit. A country can have a low level of trade but a high trade deficit. (For example, the United States only exports 13% of GDP, but it has a trade deficit of over $500 billion.)\nThree factors strongly influence a nation’s level of trade: the size of its economy, its geographic location, and its history of trade. Large economies like the United States can do much of their trading internally, while small economies like Sweden have less ability to provide what they want internally and tend to have higher ratios of exports and imports to GDP. Nations that are neighbors tend to trade more, since costs of transportation and communication are lower. Moreover, some nations have long and established patterns of international trade, while others do not.\nConsequently, a relatively small economy like Sweden, with many nearby trading partners across Europe and a long history of foreign trade, has a high level of trade. Brazil and India, which are fairly large economies that have often sought to inhibit trade in recent decades, have lower levels of trade; whereas, the United States and Japan are extremely large economies that have comparatively few nearby trading partners. Both countries actually have quite low levels of trade by world standards. The ratio of exports to GDP in either the United States or in Japan is about half of the world average.\nThe balance of trade is a separate issue from the level of trade. The United States has a low level of trade, but had enormous trade deficits for most years from the mid-1980s into the 2000s. Japan has a low level of trade by world standards, but has typically shown large trade surpluses in recent decades. Nations like Germany and the United Kingdom have medium to high levels of trade by world standards, but Germany had a moderate trade surplus in 2015, while the United Kingdom had a moderate trade deficit. Their trade picture was roughly in balance in the late 1990s. Sweden had a high level of trade and a moderate trade surplus in 2015, while Mexico had a high level of trade and a moderate trade deficit that same year.\nIn short, it is quite possible for nations with a relatively low level of trade, expressed as a percentage of GDP, to have relatively large trade deficits. It is also quite possible for nations with a near balance between exports and imports to worry about the consequences of high levels of trade for the economy. It is not inconsistent to believe that a high level of trade is potentially beneficial to an economy, because of the way it allows nations to play to their comparative advantages, and to also be concerned about any macroeconomic instability caused by a long-term pattern of large trade deficits. The following Clear It Up feature discusses how this sort of dynamic played out in Colonial India.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nARE TRADE SURPLUSES ALWAYS BENEFICIAL? CONSIDERING COLONIAL INDIA.\nIndia was formally under British rule from 1858 to 1947. During that time, India consistently had trade surpluses with Great Britain. Anyone who believes that trade surpluses are a sign of economic strength and dominance while trade deficits are a sign of economic weakness must find this pattern odd, since it would mean that colonial India was successfully dominating and exploiting Great Britain for almost a century—which was not true.\nInstead, India’s trade surpluses with Great Britain meant that each year there was an overall flow of financial capital from India to Great Britain. In India, many heavily criticized this financial capital flow as the “drain,” and they viewed eliminating the financial capital drain as one of the many reasons why India would benefit from achieving independence.\n\n\n\n6.11.1 Final Thoughts about Trade Balances\nTrade deficits can be a good or a bad sign for an economy, and trade surpluses can be a good or a bad sign. Even a trade balance of zero—which just means that a nation is neither a net borrower nor lender in the international economy—can be either a good or bad sign. The fundamental economic question is not whether a nation’s economy is borrowing or lending at all, but whether the particular borrowing or lending in the particular economic conditions of that country makes sense.\nIt is interesting to reflect on how public attitudes toward trade deficits and surpluses might change if we could somehow change the labels that people and the news media affix to them. If we called a trade deficit “attracting foreign financial capital”—which accurately describes what a trade deficit means—then trade deficits might look more attractive. Conversely, if we called a trade surplus “shipping financial capital abroad”—which accurately captures what a trade surplus does—then trade surpluses might look less attractive. Either way, the key to understanding trade balances is to understand the relationships between flows of trade and flows of international payments, and what these relationships imply about the causes, benefits, and risks of different kinds of trade balances. The first step along this journey of understanding is to move beyond knee-jerk reactions to terms like “trade surplus,” “trade balance,” and “trade deficit.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMORE THAN MEETS THE EYE IN THE CONGO\nNow that you see the big picture, you undoubtedly realize that all of the economic choices you make, such as depositing savings or investing in an international mutual fund, do influence the flow of goods and services as well as the flows of money around the world.\nYou now know that a trade surplus does not necessarily tell us whether an economy is performing well or not. The Democratic Republic of the Congo ran a trade surplus in 2013, as we learned in the beginning of the chapter. Yet its current account balance was –$2.8 billion. However, the return of political stability and the rebuilding in the aftermath of the civil war there has meant a flow of investment and financial capital into the country. In this case, a negative current account balance means the country is being rebuilt—and that is a good thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThere is a difference between the level of a country’s trade and the balance of trade. The government measures its level of trade by the percentage of exports out of GDP, or the size of the economy. Small economies that have nearby trading partners and a history of international trade will tend to have higher levels of trade. Larger economies with few nearby trading partners and a limited history of international trade will tend to have lower levels of trade. The level of trade is different from the trade balance. The level of trade depends on a country’s history of trade, its geography, and the size of its economy. A country’s balance of trade is the dollar difference between its exports and imports.\nTrade deficits and trade surpluses are not necessarily good or bad—it depends on the circumstances. Even if a country is borrowing, if it invests that money in productivity-boosting investments it can lead to an improvement in long-term economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat three factors will determine whether a nation has a higher or lower share of trade relative to its GDP?\nWhat is the difference between trade deficits and balance of trade?\nWill nations that are more involved in foreign trade tend to have higher trade imbalances, lower trade imbalances, or is the pattern unpredictable?\nSome economists warn that the persistent trade deficits and a negative current account balance that the United States has run will be a problem in the long run.

    "text": "7.2 How Economists Define and Compute Unemployment Rate\nNewspaper or television reports typically describe unemployment as a percentage or a rate. A recent report might have said, for example, from August 2009 to November 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate rose from 9.7% to 10.0%, but by June 2010, it had fallen to 9.5%. At a glance, the changes between the percentages may seem small.\nHowever, remember that the U.S. economy has about 160 million adults (as of the beginning of 2017) who either have jobs or are looking for them. A rise or fall of just 0.1% in the unemployment rate of 160 million potential workers translates into 160,000 people, which is roughly the total population of a city like Syracuse, New York, Brownsville, Texas, or Pasadena, California.\nLarge rises in the unemployment rate mean large numbers of job losses. In November 2009, at the peak of the recession, about 15 million people were out of work. Even with the unemployment rate now at 4.8% as of January 2017, about 7.6 million people who would like to have jobs are out of work.",

    "text": "7.1 UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE GREAT RECESSION\nNearly eight million U.S. jobs were lost as a consequence of the Great Recession, which lasted from December 2007 to June 2009. At the outset of the recession, the unemployment rate was 5.0%. The rate began rising several months after the recession began, and it peaked at 10.0% in October 2009, several months after the recession ended, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The job loss represented a huge number of positions gone. Subsequently, the recovery was tepid. Companies added some positions, but as of summer 2013, four years after the end of the recession, unemployment was about 7.5%, well above the pre-recession rate. Employment began increasing at the outset of 2010, and reached its pre-recession level in mid-2014. However, because of population and labor force growth, the unemployment rate at that point was still slightly above 6%. The economy only returned to an unemployment rate of 5.0% in September 2015, and it has remained at or slightly below that level since then, up through January 2017.\nThis brief overview of unemployment during and after the Great Recession highlights a few important points. First, unemployment is a lagging indicator of business activity. It didn’t begin to increase until a few months after the onset of the recession, and it didn’t begin to decline until several months after the recovery. Second, the decline in the unemployment rate was quite slow, with the pre-recession unemployment rate only reaching a higher level than six years after the recession ended. This reflects a combination of slow increase in the number of jobs and ongoing increases in the size of the population and the labor force.\nIt turns out that recent recessions, going back to the early 1990s, have been characterized by longer periods of recovery than their predecessors. We will return to this point at the end of the chapter. However, first we need to examine unemployment. What constitutes it, and how do we measure it?",

    "text": "Section Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nCalculate the labor force participation rate and the unemployment rate\nExplain hidden unemployment and what it means to be in or out of the labor force\nEvaluate the collection and interpretation of unemployment data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.1 Who’s In or Out of the Labor Force?\nShould we count everyone without a job as unemployed? Of course not. For example, we should not count children as unemployed. Surely, we should not count the retired as unemployed. Many full-time college students have only a part-time job, or no job at all, but it seems inappropriate to count them as suffering the pains of unemployment. Some people are not working because they are rearing children, ill, on vacation, or on parental leave.\nThe point is that we do not just divide the adult population into employed and unemployed. A third group exists: people who do not have a job, and for some reason—retirement, looking after children, taking a voluntary break before a new job—are not interested in having a job, either. It also includes those who do want a job but have quit looking, often due to discouragement due to their inability to find suitable employment. Economists refer to this third group of those who are not working and not looking for work as out of the labor force or not in the labor force.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate, which is based on a monthly survey carried out by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, asks a series of questions to divide the adult population into employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force. To be classified as unemployed, a person must be without a job, currently available to work, and actively looking for work in the previous four weeks. Thus, a person who does not have a job but who is not currently available to work or has not actively looked for work in the last four weeks is counted as out of the labor force.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployed: currently working for pay\n\n\n\n\nUnemployed: Out of work and actively looking for a job\nOut of the labor force: Out of paid work and not actively looking for a job\nLabor force: The number of employed plus the unemployed\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Calculating the Unemployment Rate\nFigure 7.2 shows the three-way division of the 16-and-over population. In January 2017, about 62.9% of the adult population was \"in the labor force\"; that is, people are either employed or without a job but looking for work. We can divide those in the labor force into the employed and the unemployed.\nTable 7.1 shows those values. The unemployment rate is not the percentage of the total adult population without jobs, but rather the percentage of adults who are in the labor force but who do not have jobs:\n\\[\\boxed{\\text{Unemployment rate} = \\frac{\\text{Unemployed people}}{\\text{Total labor force}}\\times 100}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.2: Employed, Unemployed, and Out of the Labor Force Distribution of Adult Population (age 16 and older), January 2017. The total adult, working-age population in January 2017 was 254.1 million. Out of this total population, 152.1 were classified as employed, and 7.6 million were classified as unemployed. The remaining 94.4 were classified as out of the labor force. As you will learn, however, this seemingly simple chart does not tell the whole story.\n\n\n\nTable 7.1 shows the corresponding figures for the US.\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: U.S. Employment and Unemployment, January 2017 (Source: https://data.bls.gov)\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nCount\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nTotal adult population over the age of 16\n254.082 million\n\n\n\nIn the labor force Employed Unemployed\n159.716 million 152.081 million 7.635 million\n62.9%\n\n\nOut of the labor force\n94.366 million\n37.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we can calculate the unemployment rate as 7.635 million unemployed people divided by 159.716 million people in the labor force, which works out to a 4.8% rate of unemployment. The following Work It Out feature will walk you through the steps of this calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCALCULATING LABOR FORCE PERCENTAGES\n\n\n\nHow do economists arrive at the percentages in and out of the labor force and the unemployment rate? We will use the values in Table 7.1 to illustrate the steps.\nTo determine the percentage in the labor force:\n\nStep 1.\n\nDivide the number of people in the labor force (159.716 million) by the total adult (working-age) population (254.082 million).\n\nStep 2.\n\nMultiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\n\n\n\\[\\text{Percentage in the labor forcer}=159.716/254.082=0.6286=62.9\\%\\]\nTo determine the percentage out of the labor force:\n\nStep 1.\n\nDivide the number of people out the labor force (94.366 million) by the total adult (working-age) population (254.082 million).\n\nStep 2.\n\nMultiply by 100 to obtain the percentage.\n\n\n\\[\\text{Percentage in the labor force} = 94.366/254.082=0.3714=37.1\\%\\]\nTo determine the unemployment rate:\n\nStep 1.\n\nDivide the number of unemployed people (7.635 million) by the total labor force (157 million).\n\nStep 2.\n\nMultiply by 100 to obtain the rate.\n\n\n\\[\\text{Unemployment rate}=7.635/159.716 = 0.0478 = 4.8\\%\\]\n\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Hidden Unemployment\nEven with the “out of the labor force” category, there are still some people who are mislabeled in the categorization of employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force. There are some people who have only part time or temporary jobs, and they are looking for full time and permanent employment that are counted as employed, although they are not employed in the way they would like or need to be. Additionally, there are individuals who are underemployed.\nThis includes those who are trained or skilled for one type or level of work but are working in a lower paying job or one that does not utilize their skills. For example, we would consider an individual with a college degree in finance who is working as a sales clerk underemployed.\nThey are, however, also counted in the employed group. All of these individuals fall under the umbrella of the term “hidden unemployment.” Discouraged workers, those who have stopped looking for employment and, hence, are no longer counted in the unemployed also fall into this group\n\n\n7.2.4 Labor Force Participation Rate\nAnother important statistic is the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of adults in an economy who are either employed or who are unemployed and looking for a job. Using the data in Figure and Table, those included in this calculation would be the 159.716 million individuals in the labor force.\nWe calculate the rate by taking the number of people in the labor force, that is, the number employed and the number unemployed, divided by the total adult population and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. For the data from January 2017, the labor force participation rate is 62.9%. Historically, the civilian labor force participation rate in the United States climbed beginning in the 1960s as women increasingly entered the workforce, and it peaked at just over 67% in late 1999 to early 2000.\nSince then, the labor force participation rate has steadily declined, slowly to about 66% in 2008, early in the Great Recession, and then more rapidly during and after that recession, reaching its present level, where it has remained stable, near the end of 2013.\n\n\n7.2.5 The Establishment Payroll Survey\nWhen the unemployment report comes out each month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) also reports on the number of jobs created—which comes from the establishment payroll survey. The payroll survey is based on a survey of about 147,000 businesses and government agencies throughout the United States.\nIt generates payroll employment estimates by the following criteria:\n\n\nall employees,\naverage weekly hours worked, and\naverage hourly, weekly, and overtime earnings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nOne of the criticisms of this survey is that it does not count the self-employed. It also does not make a distinction between new, minimum wage, part time or temporary jobs and full time jobs with “decent” pay.",

The Bureau takes great care to make this survey representative of the country as a whole. The country is first divided into 3,137 areas. The U.S. Bureau of the Census then selects 729 of these areas to survey. It divides the 729 areas into districts of about 300 households each, and divides each district into clusters of about four dwelling units. Every month, Census Bureau employees call about 15,000 of the four-household clusters, for a total of 60,000 households. Employees interview households for four consecutive months, then rotate them out of the survey for eight months, and then interview them again for the same four months the following year, before leaving the sample permanently.\nBased on this survey, state, industry, urban and rural areas, gender, age, race or ethnicity, and level of education statistics comprise components that contribute to unemployment rates. A wide variety of other information is available, too. For example, how long have people been unemployed? Did they become unemployed because they quit, or were laid off, or their employer went out of business? Is the unemployed person the only wage earner in the family? The Current Population Survey is a treasure trove of information about employment and unemployment. If you are wondering what the difference is between the CPS and EPS, read the following Clear it Up feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CPS AND EPS?\n\n\n\nThe United States Census Bureau conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS), which measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' establishment payroll survey (EPS) is a payroll survey that measures the net change in jobs created for the month.\n\n\n\n7.3.1 Criticisms of Measuring Unemployment\nThere are always complications in measuring the number of unemployed. For example, what about people who do not have jobs and would be available to work, but are discouraged by the lack of available jobs in their area and stopped looking? Such people, and their families, may be suffering the pains of unemployment. However, the survey counts them as out of the labor force because they are not actively looking for work. Other people may tell the Census Bureau that they are ready to work and looking for a job but, truly, they are not that eager to work and are not looking very hard at all. They are counted as unemployed, although they might more accurately be classified as out of the labor force. Still other people may have a job, perhaps doing something like yard work, child care, or cleaning houses, but are not reporting the income earned to the tax authorities. They may report being unemployed, when they actually are working.\nAlthough the unemployment rate gets most of the public and media attention, economic researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics publish a wide array of surveys and reports that try to measure these kinds of issues and to develop a more nuanced and complete view of the labor market. It is not exactly a hot news flash that economic statistics are imperfect. Even imperfect measures like the unemployment rate, however, can still be quite informative, when interpreted knowledgeably and sensibly.\n\n\n7.3.2 Alternative Measures of Unemployment\nAs just discussed, the official statistics for unemployment do not include the full range of individuals who would like to participate fully in the labor market\n\nIndividuals who want to work, have searched for work in the prior year, but are not currently looking for work because they believe they won’t be able to find a job are called discouraged workers\nIndividuals who would like to work, have searched for work in the recent past, but have stopped looking for work for a variety of reasons are known as marginally attached workers (e.g., temporary caretakers of children or parents)\nWorkers who would like to be employed full-time but hold part-time jobs are known as individuals working part-time for economic reasons\n\nAdding these categories to the number of unemployed workers would result in a much higher rate of unemployment than the official unemployment statistic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nUnemployment imposes high costs. Unemployed individuals suffer from loss of income and from stress. An economy with high unemployment suffers an opportunity cost of unused resources. We can divide the adult population into those in the labor force and those out of the labor force. In turn, we divide those in the labor force into employed and unemployed.\nA person without a job must be willing and able to work and actively looking for work to be counted as unemployed; otherwise, a person without a job is counted as out of the labor force. Economists define the unemployment rate as the number of unemployed persons divided by the number of persons in the labor force (not the overall adult population).\nThe Current Population Survey (CPS) conducted by the United States Census Bureau measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. The establishment payroll survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics measures the net change in jobs created for the month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the adult population over the age of 16 is 237.8 million and the labor force is 153.9 million (of whom 139.1 million are employed). How many people are “not in the labor force?” What are the proportions of employed, unemployed and not in the labor force in the population? Hint: Proportions are percentages.\nUsing the above data, what is the unemployment rate? These data are U.S. statistics from 2010. How does it compare to the February 2015 unemployment rate computed earlier?\nWhat is the difference between being unemployed and being out of the labor force?\nHow do you calculate the unemployment rate? How do you calculate the labor force participation rate?\nAre all adults who do not hold jobs counted as unemployed?\nIf you are out of school but working part time, are you considered employed or unemployed in U.S. labor statistics? If you are a full time student and working 12 hours a week at the college cafeteria are you considered employed or not in the labor force? If you are a senior citizen who is collecting social security and a pension and working as a greeter at Wal-Mart are you considered employed or not in the labor force?\nWhat happens to the unemployment rate when unemployed workers are reclassified as discouraged workers?\nWhat happens to the labor force participation rate when employed individuals are reclassified as unemployed? What happens when they are reclassified as discouraged workers?\nWhat are some of the problems with using the unemployment rate as an accurate measure of overall joblessness?\nWhat criteria do the BLS use to count someone as employed? As unemployed?",

However, over time, the unemployment rate seems to return to a range of 4% to 6%. There does not seem to be a long-term trend toward the rate moving generally higher or generally lower. (Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/LRUN64TTUSA156S0)\nAs we look at this data, several patterns stand out:\n\nUnemployment rates do fluctuate over time. During the deep recessions of the early 1980s and of 2007–2009, unemployment reached roughly 10%. For comparison, during the 1930s Great Depression, the unemployment rate reached almost 25% of the labor force.\nUnemployment rates in the late 1990s and into the mid-2000s were rather low by historical standards. The unemployment rate was below 5% from 1997 to 2000, and near 5% during almost all of 2006–2007, and 5% or slightly less from September 2015 through January 2017 (the latest date for which data are available as of this writing). The previous time unemployment had been less than 5% for three consecutive years was three decades earlier, from 1968 to 1970.\nThe unemployment rate never falls all the way to zero. It almost never seems to get below 3%—and it stays that low only for very short periods. (We discuss reasons why this is the case later in this chapter.)\nThe timing of rises and falls in unemployment matches fairly well with the timing of upswings and downswings in the overall economy, except that unemployment tends to lag changes in economic activity, and especially so during upswings of the economy following a recession. During periods of recession and depression, unemployment is high. During periods of economic growth, unemployment tends to be lower.\nNo significant upward or downward trend in unemployment rates is apparent. This point is especially worth noting because the U.S. population more than quadrupled from 76 million in 1900 to over 324 million by 2017. Moreover, a higher proportion of U.S. adults are now in the paid workforce, because women have entered the paid labor force in significant numbers in recent decades. Women comprised 18% of the paid workforce in 1900 and nearly half of the paid workforce in 2017. However, despite the increased number of workers, as well as other economic events like globalization and the continuous invention of new technologies, the economy has provided jobs without causing any long-term upward or downward trend in unemployment rates.\n\n\n\n7.4.2 Unemployment Rates by Group\nUnemployment is not distributed evenly across the U.S. population. Figure 7.3 – Figure 7.7 show unemployment rates broken down in various ways: by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.3: Unemployment by gender since 1950. Unemployment rates for men used to be lower than unemployment rates for women, but in recent decades, the two rates have been very close, often–and especially during and soon after the Great Recession–with the unemployment rate for men somewhat higher. (b) By age, 1972–2016. Unemployment rates are highest for the very young and become lower with age. (c) By race and ethnicity, 1972–2016. Although unemployment rates for all groups tend to rise and fall together, the unemployment rate for blacks is typically about twice as high as that for whites, while the unemployment rate for Hispanics is in between. (Source: www.bls.gov)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Unemployment age since 1950. Unemployment rates are highest for the very young and become lower with age. (Source: www.bls.gov)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Unemployment by race and ethnicity since 1950. Although unemployment rates for all groups tend to rise and fall together, the unemployment rate for blacks is typically about twice as high as that for whites, while the unemployment rate for Hispanics is in between. (Source: www.bls.gov)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6: Unemployment by race and gender since 1950. (Source: www.bls.gov)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7: Unemployment by education since 1950. (Source: www.bls.gov)\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate for women had historically tended to be higher than the unemployment rate for men, perhaps reflecting the historical pattern that women were seen as “secondary” earners. By about 1980, however, the unemployment rate for women was essentially the same as that for men, as Figure 7.3 shows. During the 2008-2009 recession and in the immediate aftermath, the unemployment rate for men exceeded the unemployment rate for women. Subsequently, however, the gap has narrowed.\nYounger workers tend to have higher unemployment, while middle-aged workers tend to have lower unemployment, probably because the middle-aged workers feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Younger workers move in and out of jobs more than middle-aged workers, as part of the process of matching of workers and jobs, and this contributes to their higher unemployment rates. In addition, middle-aged workers are more likely to feel the responsibility of needing to have a job more heavily. Elderly workers have extremely low rates of unemployment, because those who do not have jobs often exit the labor force by retiring, and thus are not counted in the unemployment statistics. Figure 7.4 shows unemployment rates for women divided by age. The pattern for men is similar.\nThe unemployment rate for African-Americans is substantially higher than the rate for other racial or ethnic groups, a fact that surely reflects, to some extent, a pattern of discrimination that has constrained blacks’ labor market opportunities. However, the gaps between unemployment rates for whites and for blacks and Hispanics diminished in the 1990s, as Figure 7.5 shows. In fact, unemployment rates for blacks and Hispanics were at the lowest levels for several decades in the mid-2000s before rising during the recent Great Recession.\nFinally, those with less education typically suffer higher unemployment. In January 2017, for example, the unemployment rate for those with a college degree was 2.5%; for those with some college but not a four year degree, the unemployment rate was 3.8%; for high school graduates with no additional degree, the unemployment rate was 5.3%; and for those without a high school diploma, the unemployment rate was 7.7%. This pattern arises because additional education typically offers better connections to the labor market and higher demand. With less attractive labor market opportunities for low-skilled workers compared to the opportunities for the more highly-skilled, including lower pay, low-skilled workers may be less motivated to find jobs.\n\n\n7.4.3 Breaking Down Unemployment in Other Ways\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics also gives information about the reasons for unemployment, as well as the length of time individuals have been unemployed. Table 7.2, for example, shows the four reasons for unemployment and the percentages of the currently unemployed that fall into each category.\n\n\n\nTable 7.2: Reasons for Unemployment, January 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nReason\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nNew Entrants\n10.8%\n\n\nRe-entrants\n28.7%\n\n\nJob Leavers\n11.4%\n\n\nJob Losers: Temporary\n14.0%\n\n\nJob Losers: Non Temporary\n35.1%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.3 shows the length of unemployment. For both of these, the data is from January 2017.(bls.gov)\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: Length of Unemployment, January 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nLength of Time\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nUnder 5 weeks\n32.5%\n\n\n5 to 14 weeks\n27.5%\n\n\n15 to 26 weeks\n15.7%\n\n\nOver 27 weeks\n27.4%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.4.4 International Unemployment Comparisons\nFrom an international perspective, the U.S. unemployment rate typically has looked a little better than average. Table 7.4 compares unemployment rates for 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006 (just before the recession), and 2012 (somewhat after the recession) from several other high-income countries.\n\n\n\nTable 7.4: International Comparisons of Unemployment Rates\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\n1991\n1996\n2001\n2006\n2012\n\n\n\n\nUnited States\n6.8%\n5.4%\n4.8%\n4.4%\n8.1%\n\n\nCanada\n9.8%\n8.8%\n6.4%\n6.2%\n6.3%\n\n\nJapan\n2.1%\n3.4%\n5.1%\n4.5%\n3.9%\n\n\nFrance\n9.5%\n12.5%\n8.7%\n10.1%\n10.0%\n\n\nGermany\n5.6%\n9.0%\n8.9%\n9.8%\n5.5%\n\n\nItaly\n6.9%\n11.7%\n9.6%\n7.8%\n10.8%\n\n\nSweden\n3.1%\n9.9%\n5.0%\n5.2%\n7.9%\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n8.8%\n8.1%\n5.1%\n5.5%\n8.0%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we need to treat cross-country comparisons of unemployment rates with care, because each country has slightly different definitions of unemployment, survey tools for measuring unemployment, and also different labor markets. For example, Japan’s unemployment rates appear quite low, but Japan’s economy has been mired in slow growth and recession since the late 1980s, and Japan’s unemployment rate probably paints too rosy a picture of its labor market. In Japan, workers who lose their jobs are often quick to exit the labor force and not look for a new job, in which case they are not counted as unemployed. In addition, Japanese firms are often quite reluctant to fire workers, and so firms have substantial numbers of workers who are on reduced hours or officially employed, but doing very little. We can view this Japanese pattern as an unusual method for society to provide support for the unemployed, rather than a sign of a healthy economy.\nComparing unemployment rates in the United States and other high-income economies with unemployment rates in Latin America, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Asia is very difficult. One reason is that the statistical agencies in many poorer countries lack the resources and technical capabilities of the U.S. Bureau of the Census. However, a more difficult problem with international comparisons is that in many low-income countries, most workers are not involved in the labor market through an employer who pays them regularly. Instead, workers in these countries are engaged in short-term work, subsistence activities, and barter. Moreover, the effect of unemployment is very different in high-income and low-income countries. Unemployed workers in the developed economies have access to various government programs like unemployment insurance, welfare, and food stamps. Such programs may barely exist in poorer countries. Although unemployment is a serious problem in many low-income countries, it manifests itself in a different way than in high-income countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate rises during periods of recession and depression, but falls back to the range of 4% to 6% when the economy is strong. The unemployment rate never falls to zero. Despite enormous growth in the size of the U.S. population and labor force in the twentieth century, along with other major trends like globalization and new technology, the unemployment rate shows no long-term rising trend.\nUnemployment rates differ by group: higher for African-Americans and Hispanics than for whites; higher for less educated than more educated; higher for the young than the middle-aged. Women’s unemployment rates used to be higher than men’s, but in recent years men’s and women’s unemployment rates have been very similar. In recent years, unemployment rates in the United States have compared favorably with unemployment rates in most other high-income economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the long term, has the U.S. unemployment rate generally trended up, trended down, or remained at basically the same level?\nWhose unemployment rates are commonly higher in the U.S. economy: a. Whites or nonwhites? b. The young or the middle-aged? c. College graduates or high school graduates?\nAre U.S. unemployment rates typically higher, lower, or about the same as unemployment rates in other high-income countries?\nAre U.S. unemployment rates distributed evenly across the population?\nIs the higher unemployment rates for minority workers necessarily an indication of discrimination? What could be some other reasons for the higher unemployment rate?\nWhile unemployment is highly negatively correlated with the level of economic activity, in the real world it responds with a lag. In other words, firms do not immediately lay off workers in response to a sales decline. They wait a while before responding. Similarly, firms do not immediately hire workers when sales pick up. What do you think accounts for the lag in response time?\nWhy do you think that unemployment rates are lower for individuals with more education?",

    "text": "7.5 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Short Run\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze cyclical unemployment\nExplain the relationship between sticky wages and employment using various economic arguments\nApply supply and demand models to unemployment and wages\n\n\n\nWe have seen that unemployment varies across times and places. What causes changes in unemployment? There are different answers in the short run and in the long run. Let's look at the short run first.\n\n7.5.1 Cyclical Unemployment\nLet’s make the plausible assumption that in the short run, from a few months to a few years, the quantity of hours that the average person is willing to work for a given wage does not change much, so the labor supply curve does not shift much. In addition, make the standard ceteris paribus assumption that there is no substantial short-term change in the age structure of the labor force, institutions and laws affecting the labor market, or other possibly relevant factors.\nOne primary determinant of the demand for labor from firms is how they perceive the state of the macro economy. If firms believe that business is expanding, then at any given wage they will desire to hire a greater quantity of labor, and the labor demand curve shifts to the right. Conversely, if firms perceive that the economy is slowing down or entering a recession, then they will wish to hire a lower quantity of labor at any given wage, and the labor demand curve will shift to the left. Economists call the variation in unemployment that the economy causes moving from expansion to recession or from recession to expansion (i.e. the business cycle) cyclical unemployment.\nFrom the standpoint of the supply-and-demand model of competitive and flexible labor markets, unemployment represents something of a puzzle. In a supply-and-demand model of a labor market, as Figure 7.8 illustrates, the labor market should move toward an equilibrium wage and quantity. At the equilibrium wage (We), the equilibrium quantity (Qe) of labor supplied by workers should be equal to the quantity of labor demanded by employers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8: In a labor market with flexible wages, the equilibrium will occur at wage We and quantity Qe, where the number of people who want jobs (shown by S) equals the number of jobs available (shown by D).\n\n\n\nOne possibility for unemployment is that people who are unemployed are those who are not willing to work at the current equilibrium wage, say $10 an hour, but would be willing to work at a higher wage, like $20 per hour. The monthly Current Population Survey would count these people as unemployed, because they say they are ready and looking for work (at $20 per hour). However, from an economist’s perspective, these people are choosing to be unemployed.\nProbably a few people are unemployed because of unrealistic expectations about wages, but they do not represent the majority of the unemployed. Instead, unemployed people often have friends or acquaintances of similar skill levels who are employed, and the unemployed would be willing to work at the jobs and wages similar to what those people are receiving. However, the employers of their friends and acquaintances do not seem to be hiring. In other words, these people are involuntarily unemployed. What causes involuntary unemployment?\n\n\n7.5.2 Why Wages Might Be Sticky Downward\nIf a labor market model with flexible wages does not describe unemployment very well—because it predicts that anyone willing to work at the going wage can always find a job—then it may prove useful to consider economic models in which wages are not flexible or adjust only very slowly. In particular, even though wage increases may occur with relative ease, wage decreases are few and far between.\nOne set of reasons why wages may be “sticky downward,” as economists put it, involves economic laws and institutions. For low-skilled workers receiving minimum wage, it is illegal to reduce their wages. For union workers operating under a multiyear contract with a company, wage cuts might violate the contract and create a labor dispute or a strike. However, minimum wages and union contracts are not a sufficient reason why wages would be sticky downward for the U.S. economy as a whole. After all, out of the 150 million or so employed workers in the U.S. economy, only about 2.6 million—less than 2% of the total—do not receive compensation above the minimum wage. Similarly, labor unions represent only about 11% of American wage and salary workers. In other high-income countries, more workers may have their wages determined by unions or the minimum wage may be set at a level that applies to a larger share of workers. However, for the United States, these two factors combined affect only about 15% or less of the labor force.\nEconomists looking for reasons why wages might be sticky downwards have focused on factors that may characterize most labor relationships in the economy, not just a few. Many have proposed a number of different theories, but they share a common tone.\nOne argument is that even employees who are not union members often work under an implicit contract, which is that the employer will try to keep wages from falling when the economy is weak or the business is having trouble, and the employee will not expect huge salary increases when the economy or the business is strong. This wage-setting behavior acts like a form of insurance: the employee has some protection against wage declines in bad times, but pays for that protection with lower wages in good times. Clearly, this sort of implicit contract means that firms will be hesitant to cut wages, lest workers feel betrayed and work less hard or even leave the firm.\nEfficiency wage theory argues that workers' productivity depends on their pay, and so employers will often find it worthwhile to pay their employees somewhat more than market conditions might dictate. One reason is that employees who receive better pay than others will be more productive because they recognize that if they were to lose their current jobs, they would suffer a decline in salary. As a result, they are motivated to work harder and to stay with the current employer. In addition, employers know that it is costly and time-consuming to hire and train new employees, so they would prefer to pay workers a little extra now rather than to lose them and have to hire and train new workers. Thus, by avoiding wage cuts, the employer minimizes costs of training and hiring new workers, and reaps the benefits of well-motivated employees.\nThe adverse selection of wage cuts argument points out that if an employer reacts to poor business conditions by reducing wages for all workers, then the best workers, those with the best employment alternatives at other firms, are the most likely to leave. The least attractive workers, with fewer employment alternatives, are more likely to stay. Consequently, firms are more likely to choose which workers should depart, through layoffs and firings, rather than trimming wages across the board. Sometimes companies that are experiencing difficult times can persuade workers to take a pay cut for the short term, and still retain most of the firm’s workers. However, it is far more typical for companies to lay off some workers, rather than to cut wages for everyone.\nThe insider-outsider model of the labor force, in simple terms, argues that those already working for firms are “insiders,” while new employees, at least for a time, are “outsiders.” A firm depends on its insiders to keep the organization running smoothly, to be familiar with routine procedures, and to train new employees. However, cutting wages will alienate the insiders and damage the firm’s productivity and prospects.\nFinally, the relative wage coordination argument points out that even if most workers were hypothetically willing to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experiences such a decline, there is no obvious way for a decentralized economy to implement such a plan. Instead, workers confronted with the possibility of a wage cut will worry that other workers will not have such a wage cut, and so a wage cut means being worse off both in absolute terms and relative to others. As a result, workers fight hard against wage cuts.\nThese theories of why wages tend not to move downward differ in their logic and their implications, and figuring out the strengths and weaknesses of each theory is an ongoing subject of research and controversy among economists. All tend to imply that wages will decline only very slowly, if at all, even when the economy or a business is having tough times. When wages are inflexible and unlikely to fall, then either short-run or long-run unemployment can result. Figure 7.9 illustrates this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: Because the wage rate is stuck at W, above the equilibrium, the number of those who want jobs (Qs) is greater than the number of job openings (Qd). The result is unemployment, shown by the bracket in the figure.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10 shows the interaction between shifts in labor demand and wages that are sticky downward. Figure 7.10 (a) illustrates the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the right from \\(D_0\\) to \\(D_1\\). In this case, the equilibrium wage rises from W0 to \\(W_1\\) and the equilibrium quantity of labor hired increases from \\(Q_0\\) to \\(Q_1\\). It does not hurt employee morale at all for wages to rise.\nFigure 7.10 (b) shows the situation in which the demand for labor shifts to the left, from \\(D_0\\) to \\(D_1\\), as it would tend to do in a recession. Because wages are sticky downward, they do not adjust toward what would have been the new equilibrium wage (\\(W_1\\)), at least not in the short run. Instead, after the shift in the labor demand curve, the same quantity of workers is willing to work at that wage as before; however, the quantity of workers demanded at that wage has declined from the original equilibrium (\\(Q_0\\)) to \\(Q_2\\). The gap between the original equilibrium quantity (\\(Q_0\\)) and the new quantity demanded of labor (\\(Q_2\\)) represents workers who would be willing to work at the going wage but cannot find jobs. The gap represents the economic meaning of unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: Panel (a) in a labor market where wages are able to rise, an increase in the demand for labor from \\(D_0\\) to \\(D_1\\) leads to an increase in equilibrium quantity of labor hired from \\(Q_0\\) to \\(Q_1\\) and a rise in the equilibrium wage from W0 to \\(W_1\\). (b) In a labor market where wages do not decline, a fall in the demand for labor from \\(D_0\\) to \\(D_1\\) leads to a decline in the quantity of labor demanded at the original wage (W0) from \\(Q_0\\) to \\(Q_2\\). These workers will want to work at the prevailing wage (W0), but will not be able to find jobs.\n\n\n\nThis analysis helps to explain the connection that we noted earlier: that unemployment tends to rise in recessions and to decline during expansions. The overall state of the economy shifts the labor demand curve and, combined with wages that are sticky downwards, unemployment changes. The rise in unemployment that occurs because of a recession is cyclical unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nCyclical unemployment rises and falls with the business cycle.\nIn a labor market with flexible wages, wages will adjust in such a market so that quantity demanded of labor always equals the quantity supplied of labor at the equilibrium wage.\nEconomists have proposed many theories for why wages might not be flexible, but instead may adjust only in a “sticky” way, especially when it comes to downward adjustments: implicit contracts, efficiency wage theory, adverse selection of wage cuts, insider-outsider model, and relative wage coordination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen would you expect cyclical unemployment to be rising? Falling?\nWhy is there unemployment in a labor market with flexible wages?\nName and explain some of the reasons why wages are likely to be sticky, especially in downward adjustments.\nDo you think it is rational for workers to prefer sticky wages to wage cuts, when the consequence of sticky wages is unemployment for some workers? Why or why not? How do the reasons for sticky wages explained in this section apply to your argument?",

    "text": "7.6 What Causes Changes in Unemployment over the Long Run\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain frictional and structural unemployment\nAssess relationships between the natural rate of employment and potential real GDP, productivity, and public policy\nIdentify recent patterns in the natural rate of employment\nPropose ways to combat unemployment\n\n\n\nCyclical unemployment explains why unemployment rises during a recession and falls during an economic expansion, but what explains the remaining level of unemployment even in good economic times? Why is the unemployment rate never zero? Even when the U.S. economy is growing strongly, the unemployment rate only rarely dips as low as 4%. Moreover, the discussion earlier in this chapter pointed out that unemployment rates in many European countries like Italy, France, and Germany have often been remarkably high at various times in the last few decades. Why does some level of unemployment persist even when economies are growing strongly? Why are unemployment rates continually higher in certain economies, through good economic years and bad? Economists have a term to describe the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy: they call it the natural rate of unemployment.\n\n7.6.1 The Long Run: The Natural Rate of Unemployment\nThe natural rate of unemployment is not “natural” in the sense that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit. It is not a physical and unchanging law of nature. Instead, it is only the “natural” rate because it is the unemployment rate that would result from the combination of economic, social, and political factors that exist at a time—assuming the economy was neither booming nor in recession.\nThese forces include the usual pattern of companies expanding and contracting their workforces in a dynamic economy, social and economic forces that affect the labor market, or public policies that affect either the eagerness of people to work or the willingness of businesses to hire. Let’s discuss these factors in more detail.\n\n\n7.6.2 Frictional Unemployment\nIn a market economy, some companies are always going broke for a variety of reasons: old technology; poor management; good management that happened to make bad decisions; shifts in tastes of consumers so that less of the firm’s product is desired; a large customer who went broke; or tough domestic or foreign competitors. Conversely, other companies will be doing very well for just the opposite reasons and looking to hire more employees. In a perfect world, all of those who lost jobs would immediately find new ones. However, in the real world, even if the number of job seekers is equal to the number of job vacancies, it takes time to find out about new jobs, to interview and figure out if the new job is a good match, or perhaps to sell a house and buy another in proximity to a new job. Economists call the unemployment that occurs in the meantime, as workers move between jobs, frictional unemployment. Frictional unemployment is not inherently a bad thing. It takes time on part of both the employer and the individual to match those looking for employment with the correct job openings. For individuals and companies to be successful and productive, you want people to find the job for which they are best suited, not just the first job offered.\nIn the mid-2000s, before the 2008–2009 recession, it was true that about 7% of U.S. workers saw their jobs disappear in any three-month period. However, in periods of economic growth, these destroyed jobs are counterbalanced for the economy as a whole by a larger number of jobs created. In 2005, for example, there were typically about 7.5 million unemployed people at any given time in the U.S. economy. Even though about two-thirds of those unemployed people found a job in 14 weeks or fewer, the unemployment rate did not change much during the year, because those who found new jobs were largely offset by others who lost jobs.\nOf course, it would be preferable if people who were losing jobs could immediately and easily move into newly created jobs, but in the real world, that is not possible. Someone who is laid off by a textile mill in South Carolina cannot turn around and immediately start working for a textile mill in California. Instead, the adjustment process happens in ripples. Some people find new jobs near their old ones, while others find that they must move to new locations. Some people can do a very similar job with a different company, while others must start new career paths. Some people may be near retirement and decide to look only for part-time work, while others want an employer that offers a long-term career path. The frictional unemployment that results from people moving between jobs in a dynamic economy may account for one to two percentage points of total unemployment.\nThe level of frictional unemployment will depend on how easy it is for workers to learn about alternative jobs, which may reflect the ease of communications about job prospects in the economy. The extent of frictional unemployment will also depend to some extent on how willing people are to move to new areas to find jobs—which in turn may depend on history and culture.\nFrictional unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment also seem to depend on the age distribution of the population. [link] (b) showed that unemployment rates are typically lower for people between 25–54 years of age or aged 55 and over than they are for those who are younger. “Prime-age workers,” as those in the 25–54 age bracket are sometimes called, are typically at a place in their lives when they want to have a job and income arriving at all times. In addition, older workers who lose jobs may prefer to opt for retirement. By contrast, it is likely that a relatively high proportion of those who are under 25 will be trying out jobs and life options, and this leads to greater job mobility and hence higher frictional unemployment. Thus, a society with a relatively high proportion of young workers, like the U.S. beginning in the mid-1960s when Baby Boomers began entering the labor market, will tend to have a higher unemployment rate than a society with a higher proportion of its workers in older ages.\n\n\n7.6.3 Structural Unemployment\nAnother factor that influences the natural rate of unemployment is the amount of structural unemployment. The structurally unemployed are individuals who have no jobs because they lack skills valued by the labor market, either because demand has shifted away from the skills they do have, or because they never learned any skills. An example of the former would be the unemployment among aerospace engineers after the U.S. space program downsized in the 1970s. An example of the latter would be high school dropouts.\nSome people worry that technology causes structural unemployment. In the past, new technologies have put lower skilled employees out of work, but at the same time they create demand for higher skilled workers to use the new technologies. Education seems to be the key in minimizing the amount of structural unemployment. Individuals who have degrees can be retrained if they become structurally unemployed. For people with no skills and little education, that option is more limited.\n\n\n7.6.4 Natural Unemployment and Potential Real GDP\nThe natural unemployment rate is related to two other important concepts: full employment and potential real GDP. Economists consider the economy to be at full employment when the actual unemployment rate is equal to the natural unemployment rate. When the economy is at full employment, real GDP is equal to potential real GDP.\nBy contrast, when the economy is below full employment, the unemployment rate is greater than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is less than potential. Finally, when the economy is above full employment, then the unemployment rate is less than the natural unemployment rate and real GDP is greater than potential. Operating above potential is only possible for a short while, since it is analogous to all workers working overtime.\n\n\n7.6.5 Productivity Shifts and the Natural Rate of Unemployment\nUnexpected shifts in productivity can have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. Over time, workers' productivity determines the level of wages in an economy. After all, if a business paid workers more than could be justified by their productivity, the business will ultimately lose money and go bankrupt. Conversely, if a business tries to pay workers less than their productivity then, in a competitive labor market, other businesses will find it worthwhile to hire away those workers and pay them more.\nHowever, adjustments of wages to productivity levels will not happen quickly or smoothly. Employers typically review wages only once or twice a year. In many modern jobs, it is difficult to measure productivity at the individual level. For example, how precisely would one measure the quantity produced by an accountant who is one of many people working in the tax department of a large corporation? Because productivity is difficult to observe, employers often determine wage increases based on recent experience with productivity. If productivity has been rising at, say, 2% per year, then wages rise at that level as well. However, when productivity changes unexpectedly, it can affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time.\nThe U.S. economy in the 1970s and 1990s provides two vivid examples of this process. In the 1970s, productivity growth slowed down unexpectedly (as we discussed in Economic Growth). For example, output per hour of U.S. workers in the business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.3% per year from 1960 to 1973, but only 0.8% from 1973 to 1982. Figure 7.11 (a) illustrates the situation where the demand for labor—that is, the quantity of labor that business is willing to hire at any given wage—has been shifting out a little each year because of rising productivity, from \\(D_0\\) to \\(D_1\\) to \\(D_2\\).\nAs a result, equilibrium wages have been rising each year from W0 to \\(W_1\\) to \\(W_2\\). However, when productivity unexpectedly slows down, the pattern of wage increases does not adjust right away. Wages keep rising each year from \\(W_2\\) to \\(W_3\\) to \\(W_4\\), but the demand for labor is no longer shifting up. A gap opens where the quantity of labor supplied at wage level \\(W_4\\) is greater than the quantity demanded. The natural rate of unemployment rises. In the aftermath of this unexpectedly low productivity in the 1970s, the national unemployment rate did not fall below 7% from May, 1980 until 1986. Over time, the rise in wages will adjust to match the slower gains in productivity, and the unemployment rate will ease back down, but this process may take years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.11: Panel (a) productivity is rising, increasing the demand for labor. Employers and workers become used to the pattern of wage increases. Then productivity suddenly stops increasing. However, the expectations of employers and workers for wage increases do not shift immediately, so wages keep rising as before. However, the demand for labor has not increased, so at wage \\(W_4\\), unemployment exists where the quantity supplied of labor exceeds the quantity demanded. (b) The rate of productivity increase has been zero for a time, so employers and workers have come to accept the equilibrium wage level (W). Then productivity increases unexpectedly, shifting demand for labor from \\(D_0\\) to \\(D_1\\). At the wage (W), this means that the quantity demanded of labor exceeds the quantity supplied, and with job offers plentiful, the unemployment rate will be low.\n\n\n\nThe late 1990s provide an opposite example: instead of the surprise decline in productivity that occurred in the 1970s, productivity unexpectedly rose in the mid-1990s. The annual growth rate of real output per hour of labor increased from 1.7% from 1980–1995, to an annual rate of 2.6% from 1995–2001. Let’s simplify the situation a bit, so that the economic lesson of the story is easier to see graphically, and say that productivity had not been increasing at all in earlier years, so the intersection of the labor market was at point E in Figure 7.11 (b), where the demand curve for labor (\\(D_0\\)) intersects the supply curve for labor.\nAs a result, real wages were not increasing. Now, productivity jumps upward, which shifts the demand for labor out to the right, from \\(D_0\\) to \\(D_1\\). At least for a time, however, wages are still set according to the earlier expectations of no productivity growth, so wages do not rise. The result is that at the prevailing wage level (W), the quantity of labor demanded (Qd) will for a time exceed the quantity of labor supplied (Qs), and unemployment will be very low—actually below the natural level of unemployment for a time. This pattern of unexpectedly high productivity helps to explain why the unemployment rate stayed below 4.5%—quite a low level by historical standards—from 1998 until after the U.S. economy had entered a recession in 2001.\nLevels of unemployment will tend to be somewhat higher on average when productivity is unexpectedly low, and conversely, will tend to be somewhat lower on average when productivity is unexpectedly high. However, over time, wages do eventually adjust to reflect productivity levels.\n\n\n7.6.6 Public Policy and the Natural Rate of Unemployment\nPublic policy can also have a powerful effect on the natural rate of unemployment. On the supply side of the labor market, public policies to assist the unemployed can affect how eager people are to find work. For example, if a worker who loses a job is guaranteed a generous package of unemployment insurance, welfare benefits, food stamps, and government medical benefits, then the opportunity cost of unemployment is lower and that worker will be less eager to seek a new job.\nWhat seems to matter most is not just the amount of these benefits, but how long they last. A society that provides generous help for the unemployed that cuts off after, say, six months, may provide less of an incentive for unemployment than a society that provides less generous help that lasts for several years. Conversely, government assistance for job search or retraining can in some cases encourage people back to work sooner. See the Clear it Up to learn how the U.S. handles unemployment insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW DOES U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WORK?\nUnemployment insurance is a joint federal–state program that the federal government enacted in 1935. While the federal government sets minimum standards for the program, state governments conduct most of the administration.\nThe funding for the program is a federal tax collected from employers. The federal government requires tax collection on the first $7,000 in wages paid to each worker; however, states can choose to collect the tax on a higher amount if they wish, and 41 states have set a higher limit.\nStates can choose the length of time that they pay benefits, although most states limit unemployment benefits to 26 weeks—with extensions possible in times of especially high unemployment. The states then use the fund to pay benefits to those who become unemployed. Average unemployment benefits are equal to about one-third of the wage that the person earned in his or her previous job, but the level of unemployment benefits varies considerably across states.\n\nMaximum Weekly Unemployment Benefits by State in 2017(Source: http://www.savingtoinvest.com/maximum-weekly-unemployment-benefits-by-state/)\n\n\nBottom 10 States:\nLowest Benefit per Week\nTop 10 States:\nHighest Benefit per Week\n\n\n\n\nDelaware\n$330\nMassachusetts\n$672\n\n\nGeorgia\n$330\nMinnesota\n$683\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n$326\nWashington\n$681\n\n\nMissouri\n$320\nNew Jersey\n$657\n\n\nFlorida\n$275\nNorth Dakota\n$633\n\n\nTennessee\n$275\nConnecticut\n$598\n\n\nAlabama\n$265\nOregon\n$590\n\n\nLouisiana\n$247\nPennsylvania\n$573\n\n\nArizona\n$240\nColorado\n$568\n\n\nMississippi\n$235\nRhode Island\n$566\n\n\n\nOne other interesting thing to note about the classifications of unemployment—an individual does not have to collect unemployment benefits to be classified as unemployed. While there are statistics kept and studied relating to how many people are collecting unemployment insurance, this is not the source of unemployment rate information.\n\n\nOn the demand side of the labor market, government rules social institutions, and the presence of unions can affect the willingness of firms to hire. For example, if a government makes it hard for businesses to start up or to expand, by wrapping new businesses in bureaucratic red tape, then businesses will become more discouraged about hiring. Government regulations can make it harder to start a business by requiring that a new business obtain many permits and pay many fees, or by restricting the types and quality of products that a company can sell. Other government regulations, like zoning laws, may limit where companies can conduct business, or whether businesses are allowed to be open during evenings or on Sunday.\nWhatever defenses may be offered for such laws in terms of social value—like the value some Christians place on not working on Sunday, or Orthodox Jews or highly observant Muslims on Saturday—these kinds of restrictions impose a barrier between some willing workers and other willing employers, and thus contribute to a higher natural rate of unemployment. Similarly, if government makes it difficult to fire or lay off workers, businesses may react by trying not to hire more workers than strictly necessary—since laying these workers off would be costly and difficult. High minimum wages may discourage businesses from hiring low-skill workers. Government rules may encourage and support powerful unions, which can then push up wages for union workers, but at a cost of discouraging businesses from hiring those workers.\n\n\n7.6.7 The Role of Minimum Wages: Do They Cause Unemployment?\nThe discussion about the role of minimum wages is extremely controversial and there is no consensus in the economics profession about whether a minimum wage ultimately increases unemployment by \"destroying\" low wage paying jobs.\nAs of this writing (Jan. 2021) President Biden is calling for an increase of the Federal minimum wage from USD 7.25 to USD 15.00. The Federal minimum wage has not changed in 12 years despite efforts under President Barack Obama to raise it from USD 7.25 to USD 8.50.\nUnder the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, states and localities are permitted to set their own minimum wage rates, which will take precedence over the Federal minimum wage rate if they are higher. For this reason there are now a variety of minimum wages by State but also local municipality. If a municipality sets a minimum wage, it takes precedent over the Federal and State minimum wage as long as it is higher of course.\nYou can find a list of the current minimum wages by State on https://www.minimum-wage.org\nHere are some municipalities with the highest minimum wages.\n\n\n\nState Name\nLocality Name\nMinimum Wage Rate\n\n\n\n\nMaine\nPortland\n$18.00 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nEmeryville\n$16.84 per hour\n\n\nWashington\nSea Tac\n$16.57 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nMountain View\n$16.30 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nSan Francisco\n$16.07 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nBelmont\n$15.90 per hour\n\n\nWashington\nSeattle\n$15.75 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nPalo Alto\n$15.65 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nSan Mateo\n$15.62 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nEl Cerrito\n$15.61 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nSan Jose\n$15.45 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nMilpitas\n$15.40 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nRedwood City\n$15.38 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nMenlo Park\n$15.25 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nSonoma\n$15.00 per hour\n\n\nNew York\nNew York City\n$15.00 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nDaily City\n$15.00 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nRichmond\n$15.00 per hour\n\n\nCalifornia\nHalf Moon Bay\n$15.00 per hour\n\n\nD.C.\nWashington DC\n$15.00 per hour\n\n\n\nAnd here is a list of States that either have no State minimum wage or have simply adopted the Federal minimum wage rate:\n\n\n\nState Name\nMinimum Wage Rate\n\n\n\n\nAlabama\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nGeorgia\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nIdaho\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nIndiana\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nIowa\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nKansas\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nKentucky\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nLouisiana\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nMississippi\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nOklahoma\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nPennsylvania\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nTennessee\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nTexas\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nUtah\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nVirginia\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nWisconsin\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nWyoming\n$7.25 per hour\n\n\nPuerto Rico\n$6.55 per hour\n\n\n\nEconomists are divided about the role of the minimum wage. Traditionally, the camp that is against the minimum wage is more rooted in economic theory while the camp that is in support of minimum wages tend to be economists that work more empirically (i.e., with data).\n\nVideo - Monopsony Employers and Minimum Wages\n\n    \n\n\nThe argument against a minimum wage is usually that it destroys jobs as a high minimum wage would make it unprofitable for employers to hire workers to do certain low productivity tasks (e.g., bagging groceries, wait staff at restaurants, ...). This would then hurt the poor, exactly the group that a minimum wage is supposed to support. There is also an important distinction to be made about the short term and the long term effects of minimum wages. See for instance the discussion here: https://voxeu.org/article/long-run-employment-effects-minimum-wage\n\nBackground Video 1 - Introduction to Labor Markets\n\n    \n\n\nIn the Video you see a description of these theoretical arguments. You will also find a somewhat surprising result that if the government forces a wage increase (that is not too large) rational firms may end up hiring more workers IF the firm is a monopsony! Keep in mind that you only find this somewhat surprising result if the increase in the wage is not TOO large. It is clearly the case that if the government were to increase the minimum wage to say USD 1000, many jobs would disappear and firms would of course NOT hire more workers. If you need more background on how labor markets work, please check out these two additional videos or consult your Econ 201 (Microeconomics) textbooks.\n\nBackground Video 2 - A Monopsonistic Market for Labor\n\n    \n\n\nThe argument in favor of minimum wages is that work should allow an employee to be able to afford a certain minimum living standard.This is often combined with equity arguments and discussions of fairness and dignity. There is a closely related discussion on living wages which are wages required to meet minimum standards given the local cost of living. MIT has developed a living wage calculator: https://livingwage.mit.edu In addition, paying higher wages can also increase local economic activity as low income households are more likely to spend additional income which stimulates the economy.\nWhile nobody is arguing that very large increases in minimum wages are \"good\", recent empirical work seems to suggest that more moderate increases of the minimum wage did not have negative labor market effects in the US between 1979--2016. (See the work by Cengiz, Dube, Lindner, and Zipperer in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, 2019, Volume 134, Issue 3 at https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz014).\nSome economists therefore suggest to link the minimum wage to average or median wages automatically so that repeatedly fighting over the minimum wage, which distracts attention from other important labor issues, can be avoided.\nHowever, it is still true that overall the minimum wage literature seems to find negative employmentment effects from minimum wage increases. For workers who already work in low wage sectors, the effect of minimum wage increases on their employment is less clear cut though. (See the work by Neumark, D. & Shirley, P. Myth or Measurement: What Does the New Minimum Wage Research Say about Minimum Wages and Job Loss in the United States? 2021, NBER Working Paper No. 28388 at https://www.nber.org/papers/w28388).\n\n\n7.6.8 The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Recent Years\nThe underlying economic, social, and political factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, which means that the natural rate of unemployment can change over time, too.\nEstimates by economists of the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy in the early 2000s run at about 4.5 to 5.5%. This is a lower estimate than earlier. We outline three of the common reasons that economists propose for this change below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe internet has provided a remarkable new tool through which job seekers can find out about jobs at different companies and can make contact with relative ease. An internet search is far easier than trying to find a list of local employers and then hunting up phone numbers for all of their human resources departments, and requesting a list of jobs and application forms. Social networking sites such as LinkedIn have changed how people find work as well.\nThe growth of the temporary worker industry has probably helped to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. In the early 1980s, only about 0.5% of all workers held jobs through temp agencies. By the early 2000s, the figure had risen above 2%. Temp agencies can provide jobs for workers while they are looking for permanent work. They can also serve as a clearinghouse, helping workers find out about jobs with certain employers and getting a tryout with the employer. For many workers, a temp job is a stepping-stone to a permanent job that they might not have heard about or obtained any other way, so the growth of temp jobs will also tend to reduce frictional unemployment.\nThe aging of the “baby boom generation”—the especially large generation of Americans born between 1946 and 1964—meant that the proportion of young workers in the economy was relatively high in the 1970s, as the boomers entered the labor market, but is relatively low today. As we noted earlier, middle-aged and older workers are far more likely to experience low unemployment than younger workers, a factor that tends to reduce the natural rate of unemployment as the baby boomers age.\n\n\nThe combined result of these factors is that the natural rate of unemployment was on average lower in the 1990s and the early 2000s than in the 1980s. The 2008–2009 Great Recession pushed monthly unemployment rates up to 10% in late 2009. However, even at that time, the Congressional Budget Office was forecasting that by 2015, unemployment rates would fall back to about 5%. During the last four months of 2015 the unemployment rate held steady at 5.0%. Throughout 2016 and up through January 2017, the unemployment rate has remained at or slightly below 5%. As of the first quarter of 2017, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the natural rate to be 4.74%, and the measured unemployment rate for January 2017 is 4.8%.\n\n\n7.6.9 The Natural Rate of Unemployment in Europe\nBy the standards of other high-income economies, the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. economy appears relatively low. Through good economic years and bad, many European economies have had unemployment rates hovering near 10%, or even higher, since the 1970s. European rates of unemployment have been higher not because recessions in Europe have been deeper, but rather because the conditions underlying supply and demand for labor have been different in Europe, in a way that has created a much higher natural rate of unemployment.\nMany European countries have a combination of generous welfare and unemployment benefits, together with nests of rules that impose additional costs on businesses when they hire. In addition, many countries have laws that require firms to give workers months of notice before laying them off and to provide substantial severance or retraining packages after laying them off. The legally required notice before laying off a worker can be more than three months in Spain, Germany, Denmark, and Belgium, and the legally required severance package can be as high as a year’s salary or more in Austria, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Such laws will surely discourage laying off or firing current workers. However, when companies know that it will be difficult to fire or lay off workers, they also become hesitant about hiring in the first place.\nWe can attribute the typically higher levels of unemployment in many European countries in recent years, which have prevailed even when economies are growing at a solid pace, to the fact that the sorts of laws and regulations that lead to a high natural rate of unemployment are much more prevalent in Europe than in the United States.\n\n\n7.6.10 A Preview of Policies to Fight Unemployment\nThe Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy and Macroeconomic Policy Around the World chapters provide a detailed discussion of how to fight unemployment, when we can discuss these policies in the context of the full array of macroeconomic goals and frameworks for analysis. However, even at this preliminary stage, it is useful to preview the main issues concerning policies to fight unemployment.\nThe remedy for unemployment will depend on the diagnosis. Cyclical unemployment is a short-term problem, caused because the economy is in a recession. Thus, the preferred solution will be to avoid or minimize recessions. As Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy discusses, governments can enact this policy by stimulating the overall buying power in the economy, so that firms perceive that sales and profits are possible, which makes them eager to hire.\nDealing with the natural rate of unemployment is trickier. In a market-oriented economy, firms will hire and fire workers. Governments cannot control this. Furthermore, the evolving age structure of the economy's population, or unexpected shifts in productivity are beyond a government's control and, will affect the natural rate of unemployment for a time. However, as the example of high ongoing unemployment rates for many European countries illustrates, government policy clearly can affect the natural rate of unemployment that will persist even when GDP is growing.\nWhen a government enacts policies that will affect workers or employers, it must examine how these policies will affect the information and incentives employees and employers have to find one another. For example, the government may have a role to play in helping some of the unemployed with job searches. Governments may need to rethink the design of their programs that offer assistance to unemployed workers and protections to employed workers so that they will not unduly discourage the supply of labor. Similarly, governments may need to reassess rules that make it difficult for businesses to begin or to expand so that they will not unduly discourage the demand for labor. The message is not that governments should repeal all laws affecting labor markets, but only that when they enact such laws, a society that cares about unemployment will need to consider the tradeoffs involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUNEMPLOYMENT AND THE GREAT RECESSION\n\n\n\nIn the review of unemployment during and after the Great Recession at the outset of this chapter, we noted that unemployment tends to be a lagging indicator of business activity. This has historically been the case, and it is evident for all recessions that have taken place since the end of World War II. In brief, this results from the costs to employers of recruitment, hiring, and training workers. Those costs represent investments by firms in their work forces.\nAt the outset of a recession, when a firm realizes that demand for its product or service is not as strong as anticipated, it has an incentive to lay off workers. However, doing so runs the risk of losing those workers, and if the weak demand proves to be only temporary, the firm will be obliged to recruit, hire, and train new workers. Thus, firms tend to retain workers initially in a downturn. Similarly, as business begins to pick up when a recession is over, firms are not sure if the improvement will last. Rather than incur the costs of hiring and training new workers, they will wait, and perhaps resort to overtime work for existing workers, until they are confident that the recession is over.\nAnother point that we noted at the outset is that the duration of recoveries in employment following recessions has been longer following the last three recessions (going back to the early 1990s) than previously. Nir Jaimovich and Henry Siu have argued that these “jobless recoveries” are a consequence of job polarization – the disappearance of employment opportunities focused on “routine” tasks. Job polarization refers to the increasing concentration of employment in the highest- and lowest-wage occupations, as jobs in middle-skill occupations disappear. Job polarization is an outcome of technological progress in robotics, computing, and information and communication technology. The result of this progress is a decline in demand for labor in occupations that perform “routine” tasks – tasks that are limited in scope and can be performed by following a well-defined set of procedures – and hence a decline in the share of total employment that is composed of routine occupations. Jaimovich and Siu have shown that job polarization characterizes the aftermath of the last three recessions, and this appears to be responsible for the jobless recoveries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe natural rate of unemployment is the rate of unemployment that the economic, social, and political forces in the economy would cause even when the economy is not in a recession.\nThese factors include the frictional unemployment that occurs when people either choose to change jobs or are put out of work for a time by the shifts of a dynamic and changing economy.\nThey also include any laws concerning conditions of hiring and firing that have the undesired side effect of discouraging job formation.\nThey also include structural unemployment, which occurs when demand shifts permanently away from a certain type of job skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the increase in labor force participation rates among women better thought of as causing an increase in cyclical unemployment or an increase in the natural rate of unemployment? Why?\nMany college students graduate from college before they have found a job. When graduates begin to look for a job, they are counted as what category of unemployed?\nWhat term describes the remaining level of unemployment that occurs even when the economy is healthy?\nWhat forces create the natural rate of unemployment for an economy?\nWould you expect the natural rate of unemployment to be roughly the same in different countries?\nWould you expect the natural rate of unemployment to remain the same within one country over the long run of several decades?\nWhat is frictional unemployment? Give examples of frictional unemployment.\nWhat is structural unemployment? Give examples of structural unemployment.\nAfter several years of economic growth, would you expect the unemployment in an economy to be mainly cyclical or mainly due to the natural rate of unemployment? Why?\nWhat type of unemployment (cyclical, frictional, or structural) applies to each of the following:\n\nlandscapers laid off in response to drop in new housing construction during a recession.\ncoal miners laid off due to EPA regulations that shut down coal fired power\na financial analyst who quits his/her job in Chicago and is pursing similar work in Arizona\nprinters laid off due to drop in demand for printed catalogues and flyers as firms go the internet to promote an advertise their products.\nfactory workers in the U.S. laid off as the plants shut down and move to Mexico and Ireland.\n\nUnder what condition would a decrease in unemployment be bad for the economy?\nUnder what condition would an increase in the unemployment rate be a positive sign?\nAs the baby boom generation retires, the ratio of retirees to workers will increase noticeably. How will this affect the Social Security program? How will this affect the standard of living of the average American?\nUnemployment rates have been higher in many European countries in recent decades than in the United States. Is the main reason for this long-term difference in unemployment rates more likely to be cyclical unemployment or the natural rate of unemployment? Explain briefly.\nIs it desirable to pursue a goal of zero unemployment? Why or why not?\nIs it desirable to eliminate natural unemployment? Why or why not? Hint: Think about what our economy would look like today and what assumptions would have to be met to have a zero rate of natural unemployment.\nThe U.S. unemployment rate increased from 4.6% in July 2001 to 5.9% by June 2002. Without studying the subject in any detail, would you expect that a change of this kind is more likely to be due to cyclical unemployment or a change in the natural rate of unemployment? Why?",

    "text": "8.1 Tracking Inflation\nInflation is a general and ongoing rise in the level of prices in an entire economy. Inflation does not refer to a change in relative prices. A relative price change occurs when you see that the price of tuition has risen, but the price of laptops has fallen. Inflation, on the other hand, means that there is pressure for prices to rise in most markets in the economy. In addition, price increases in the supply-and-demand model were one-time events, representing a shift from a previous equilibrium to a new one. Inflation implies an ongoing rise in prices. If inflation happened for one year and then stopped, then it would not be inflation any more.\nThis chapter begins by showing how to combine prices of individual goods and services to create a measure of overall inflation. It discusses the historical and recent experience of inflation, both in the United States and in other countries around the world. Other chapters have sometimes included a note under an exhibit or a parenthetical reminder in the text saying that the numbers have been adjusted for inflation. In this chapter, it is time to show how to use inflation statistics to adjust other economic variables, so that you can tell how much of, for example, we can attribute the rise in GDP over different periods of time to an actual increase in the production of goods and services and how much we should attribute to the fact that prices for most items have risen.\nInflation has consequences for people and firms throughout the economy, in their roles as lenders and borrowers, wage-earners, taxpayers, and consumers. The chapter concludes with a discussion of some imperfections and biases in the inflation statistics, and a preview of policies for fighting inflation that we will discuss in other chapters.\nDinner table conversations where you might have heard about inflation usually entail reminiscing about when “everything seemed to cost so much less. You used to be able to buy three gallons of gasoline for a dollar and then go see an afternoon movie for another dollar.” Table 8.1 compares some prices of common goods in 1970 and 2017. Of course, the average prices in this table may not reflect the prices where you live. The cost of living in New York City is much higher than in Houston, Texas, for example. In addition, certain products have evolved over recent decades.\nA new car in 2017, loaded with antipollution equipment, safety gear, computerized engine controls, and many other technological advances, is a more advanced machine (and more fuel efficient) than your typical 1970s car. However, put details like these to one side for the moment, and look at the overall pattern.\nThe primary reason behind the price rises in Table 8.1 —and all the price increases for the other products in the economy—is not specific to the market for housing or cars or gasoline or movie tickets. Instead, it is part of a general rise in the level of all prices. At the beginning of 2017, $1 had about the same purchasing power in overall terms of goods and services as 18 cents did in 1972, because of the amount of inflation that has occurred over that time period.\nMoreover, the power of inflation does not affect just goods and services, but wages and income levels, too. The second-to-last row of Table 8.1 shows that the average hourly wage for a manufacturing worker increased nearly six-fold from 1970 to 2017. The average worker in 2017 is better educated and more productive than the average worker in 1970—but not six times more productive. Per capita GDP increased substantially from 1970 to 2017, but is the average person in the U.S. economy really more than eleven times better off in just 47 years? Not likely.\nA modern economy has millions of goods and services whose prices are continually quivering in the breezes of supply and demand. How can all of these shifts in price attribute to a single inflation rate? As with many problems in economic measurement, the conceptual answer is reasonably straightforward: Economists combine prices of a variety of goods and services into a single price level. The inflation rate is simply the percentage change in the price level. Applying the concept, however, involves some practical difficulties.",

The next step is to look at how the prices of those items change over time. In thinking about how to combine individual prices into an overall price level, many people find that their first impulse is to calculate the average of the prices. Such a calculation, however, could easily be misleading because some products matter more than others.\nChanges in the prices of goods for which people spend a larger share of their incomes will matter more than changes in the prices of goods for which people spend a smaller share of their incomes. For example, an increase of 10% in the rental rate on housing matters more to most people than whether the price of carrots rises by 10%. To construct an overall measure of the price level, economists compute a weighted average of the prices of the items in the basket, where the weights are based on the actual quantities of goods and services people buy. The following Work It Out feature walks you through the steps of calculating the annual rate of inflation based on a few products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCALCULATING AN ANNUAL RATE OF INFLATION\nConsider the simple basket of goods with only three items, represented in Table 8.2 . Say that in any given month, a college student spends money on 20 hamburgers, one bottle of aspirin, and five movies. The table provides prices for these items over four years through each time period (Pd). Prices of some goods in the basket may rise while others fall.\nIn this example, the price of aspirin does not change over the four years, while movies increase in price and hamburgers bounce up and down. The table shows the cost of buying the given basket of goods at the prices prevailing at that time.\n\n\n\nTable 8.2: A College Student's Basket of Goods\n\n\n\n\n\nItems\nHamburger\nAspirin\nMovies\nTotal\nInflation Rate\n\n\n\n\nQty\n20\n1 bottle\n5\n-\n-\n\n\nPeriod 1 Price\n$3.00\n$10.00\n$6.00\n-\n-\n\n\nPeriod 1 Amount Spent\n$60.00\n$10.00\n$30.00\n$100.00\n-\n\n\nPeriod 2 Price\n$3.20\n$10.00\n$6.50\n-\n-\n\n\nPeriod 2 Amount Spent\n$64.00\n$10.00\n$32.50\n$106.50\n6.5%\n\n\nPeriod 3 Price\n$3.10\n$10.00\n$7.00\n-\n-\n\n\nPeriod 3 Amount Spent\n$62.00\n$10.00\n$35.00\n$107.00\n0.5%\n\n\nPeriod 4 Price\n$3.50\n$10.00\n$7.50\n-\n-\n\n\nPeriod 4 Amount Spent\n$70.00\n$10.00\n$37.50\n$117.50\n9.8%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo calculate the annual rate of inflation in this example:\n\nStep 1.\n\nFind the percentage change in the cost of purchasing the overall basket of goods between the time periods. The general equation for percentage changes between two years, whether in the context of inflation or in any other calculation, is:\n\\[\\frac{(\\text{Level in new year} – \\text{Level in previous year})}{\\text{Level in\nprevious year}} \\times 100 = \\text{Percentage change}\\]\n\nStep 2.\n\nFrom period 1 to period 2, the total cost of purchasing the basket of goods in Table 8.2 rises from $100 to $106.50. Therefore, the percentage change over this time—the inflation rate—is:\n\\[\\frac{(106.50 – 100)}{100.0} = 0.065 = 6.5\\%\\]\n\nStep 3.\n\nFrom period 2 to period 3, the overall change in the cost of purchasing the basket rises from $106.50 to $107. Thus, the inflation rate over this time, again calculated by the percentage change, is approximately:\n\\[\\frac{(107 – 106.50)}{106.50} = 0.0047 = 0.47\\%\\]\n\nStep 4.\n\nFrom period 3 to period 4, the overall cost rises from $107 to $117.50. The inflation rate is thus:\n\\[\\frac{(117.50 – 107)}{107} = 0.098 = 9.8\\%\\]\n\n\nThis calculation of the change in the total cost of purchasing a basket of goods accounts for how much a student spends on each good. Hamburgers are the lowest-priced good in this example, and aspirin is the highest-priced. If an individual buys a greater quantity of a low-price good, then it makes sense that changes in the price of that good should have a larger impact on the buying power of that person’s money. The larger impact of hamburgers shows up in the “amount spent” row, where, in all time periods, hamburgers are the largest item within the amount spent row.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Index Numbers\nThe numerical results of a calculation based on a basket of goods can get a little messy. The simplified example in Table 8.2 has only three goods and the prices are in even dollars, not numbers like 79 cents or $124.99. If the list of products were much longer, and we used more realistic prices, the total quantity spent over a year might be some messy-looking number like $17,147.51 or $27,654.92.\nTo simplify the task of interpreting the price levels for more realistic and complex baskets of goods, economists typically report the price level in each period as an index number, rather than as the dollar amount for buying the basket of goods. Economists create price indices to calculate an overall average change in relative prices over time. To convert the money spent on the basket to an index number, economists arbitrarily choose one year to be the base year, or starting point from which we measure changes in prices. The base year, by definition, has an index number equal to 100. This sounds complicated, but it is really a simple math trick. In the example above, say that we choose time period 3 as the base year. Since the total amount of spending in that year is $107, we divide that amount by itself ($107) and multiply by 100. Again, this is because the index number in the base year always has to have a value of 100. Then, to figure out the values of the index number for the other years, we divide the dollar amounts for the other years by 1.07 as well. Note also that the dollar signs cancel out so that index numbers have no units.\nTable 8.3 shows calculations for the other values of the index number, based on the example in Table. Because we calculate the index numbers so that they are in exactly the same proportion as the total dollar cost of purchasing the basket of goods, we can calculate the inflation rate based on the index numbers, using the percentage change formula. Thus, the inflation rate from period 1 to period 2 would be\n\\[\\frac{(99.5 – 93.4)}{93.4} = 0.065 = 6.5\\%\\]\nThis is the same answer that we derived when measuring inflation based on the dollar cost of the basket of goods for the same time period.\n\n\n\nTable 8.3: Calculating Index Numbers When Period 3 is the Base Year\n\n\n\n\n\nPeriod\nTotal Spending\nIndex Number\nInflation Rate Since Previous Period\n\n\n\n\nPeriod 1\n$100\n\\(\\frac{100}{1.07} = 93.4\\)\n\n\n\nPeriod 2\n$106.50\n\\(\\frac{106.50}{1.07} = 99.5\\)\n\\(\\frac{99.5 – 93.4}{93.4} = 0.065 = 6.5\\%\\)\n\n\nPeriod 3\n$107\n\\(\\frac{107}{1.07} = 100.0\\)\n\\(\\frac{100 – 99.5}{99.5} = 0.005 = 0.5\\%\\)\n\n\nPeriod 4\n$117.50\n\\(\\frac{117.50}{1.07} = 109.8\\)\n\\(\\frac{109.8 – 100}{100} = 0.098 = 9.8\\%\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the inflation rate is the same whether it is based on dollar values or index numbers, then why bother with the index numbers? The advantage is that indexing allows easier eyeballing of the inflation numbers. If you glance at two index numbers like 107 and 110, you know automatically that the rate of inflation between the two years is about, but not quite exactly equal to, 3%.\nBy contrast, imagine that we express the price levels in absolute dollars of a large basket of goods, so that when you looked at the data, the numbers were $19,493.62 and $20,040.17. Most people find it difficult to eyeball those kinds of numbers and say that it is a change of about 3%.\nHowever, the two numbers expressed in absolute dollars are exactly in the same proportion of 107 to 110 as the previous example. If you’re wondering why simple subtraction of the index numbers wouldn’t work, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHY DO YOU NOT JUST SUBTRACT INDEX NUMBERS?\nA word of warning: When a price index moves from, say, 107 to 110, the rate of inflation is not exactly 3%. Remember, the inflation rate is not derived by subtracting the index numbers, but rather through the percentage-change calculation. We calculate the precise inflation rate as the price index moves from 107 to 110 as\n\\[100 \\times \\frac{(110 – 107)}{107} = 100 \\times 0.028 = 2.8\\%.\\]\nWhen the base year is fairly close to 100, a quick subtraction is not a terrible shortcut to calculating the inflation rate—but when precision matters down to tenths of a percent, subtracting will not give the right answer.\n\n\nTwo final points about index numbers are worth remembering. First, index numbers have no dollar signs or other units attached to them. Although we can use index numbers to calculate a percentage inflation rate, the index numbers themselves do not have percentage signs. Index numbers just mirror the proportions that we find in other data. They transform the other data so that it is easier to work with the data.\nSecond, the choice of a base year for the index number—that is, the year that is automatically set equal to 100—is arbitrary. We choose it as a starting point from which we can track changes in prices. In the official inflation statistics, it is common to use one base year for a few years, and then to update it, so that the base year of 100 is relatively close to the present. However, any base year that we choose for the index numbers will result in exactly the same inflation rate. To see this in the previous example, imagine that period 1 is the base year when total spending was $100, and we assign it an index number of 100. At a glance, you can see that the index numbers would now exactly match the dollar figures, and the inflation rate in the first period would be 6.5%.\nNow that we see how indexes work to track inflation, the next module will show us how economists measure the cost of living.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nEconomists measure the price level by using a basket of goods and services and calculating how the total cost of buying that basket of goods will increase over time.\nEconomists often express the price level in terms of index numbers, which transform the cost of buying the basket of goods and services into a series of numbers in the same proportion to each other, but with an arbitrary base year of 100.\nWe measure the inflation rate as the percentage change between price levels or index numbers over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do economists use a basket of goods and services to measure the price level?\nWhy do economists use index numbers to measure the price level rather than dollar value of goods?\nWhat is the difference between the price level and the rate of inflation?",

    "text": "8.2 How to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nUse the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to calculate U.S. inflation rates\nIdentify several ways the Bureau of Labor Statistics avoids biases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\nDifferentiate among the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Producer Price Index (PPI), the International Price Index, the Employment Cost Index, and the GDP deflator.\n\n\n\nThe most commonly cited measure of inflation in the United States is the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Government statisticians at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics calculate the CPI based on the prices in a fixed basket of goods and services that represents the purchases of the average family of four. In recent years, the statisticians have paid considerable attention to a subtle problem: that the change in the total cost of buying a fixed basket of goods and services over time is conceptually not quite the same as the change in the cost of living, because the cost of living represents how much it costs for a person to feel that his or her consumption provides an equal level of satisfaction or utility.\nTo understand the distinction, imagine that over the past 10 years, the cost of purchasing a fixed basket of goods increased by 25% and your salary also increased by 25%. Has your personal standard of living held constant? If you do not necessarily purchase an identical fixed basket of goods every year, then an inflation calculation based on the cost of a fixed basket of goods may be a misleading measure of how your cost of living has changed. Two problems arise here: substitution bias and quality/new goods bias.\nWhen the price of a good rises, consumers tend to purchase less of it and to seek out substitutes instead. Conversely, as the price of a good falls, people will tend to purchase more of it. This pattern implies that goods with generally rising prices should tend over time to become less important in the overall basket of goods used to calculate inflation, while goods with falling prices should tend to become more important. Consider, as an example, a rise in the price of peaches by $100 per pound. If consumers were utterly inflexible in their demand for peaches, this would lead to a big rise in the price of food for consumers. Alternatively, imagine that people are utterly indifferent to whether they have peaches or other types of fruit. Now, if peach prices rise, people completely switch to other fruit choices and the average price of food does not change at all. A fixed and unchanging basket of goods assumes that consumers are locked into buying exactly the same goods, regardless of price changes—not a very likely assumption. Thus, substitution bias—the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time—tends to overstate the rise in a consumer’s true cost of living, because it does not take into account that the person can substitute away from goods whose relative prices have risen.\nThe other major problem in using a fixed basket of goods as the basis for calculating inflation is how to deal with the arrival of improved versions of older goods or altogether new goods. Consider the problem that arises if a cereal is improved by adding 12 essential vitamins and minerals—and also if a box of the cereal costs 5% more. It would clearly be misleading to count the entire resulting higher price as inflation, because the new price reflects a higher quality (or at least different) product. Ideally, one would like to know how much of the higher price is due to the quality change, and how much of it is just a higher price. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is responsible for computing the Consumer Price Index, must deal with these difficulties in adjusting for quality changes.\nWe can think of a new product as an extreme improvement in quality—from something that did not exist to something that does. However, the basket of goods that was fixed in the past obviously does not include new goods created since then. The basket of goods and services in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is revised and updated over time, and so new products are gradually included. However, the process takes some time. For example, room air conditioners were widely sold in the early 1950s, but were not introduced into the basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index until 1964. The VCR and personal computer were available in the late 1970s and widely sold by the early 1980s, but did not enter the CPI basket of goods until 1987. By 1996, there were more than 40 million cellular phone subscribers in the United States—but cell phones were not yet part of the CPI basket of goods. The parade of inventions has continued, with the CPI inevitably lagging a few years behind.\nThe arrival of new goods creates problems with respect to the accuracy of measuring inflation. The reason people buy new goods, presumably, is that the new goods offer better value for money than existing goods. Thus, if the price index leaves out new goods, it overlooks one of the ways in which the cost of living is improving. In addition, the price of a new good is often higher when it is first introduced and then declines over time. If the new good is not included in the CPI for some years, until its price is already lower, the CPI may miss counting this price decline altogether. Taking these arguments together, the quality/new goods bias means that the rise in the price of a fixed basket of goods over time tends to overstate the rise in a consumer’s true cost of living, because it does not account for how improvements in the quality of existing goods or the invention of new goods improves the standard of living. The following Clear It Up feature is a must-read on how statisticians comprise and calculate the CPI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW DO U.S. GOVERNMENT STATISTICIANS MEASURE THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX?\nWhen the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) calculates the Consumer Price Index, the first task is to decide on a basket of goods that is representative of the purchases of the average household. We do this by using the Consumer Expenditure Survey, a national survey of about 7,000 households, which provides detailed information on spending habits. Statisticians divide consumer expenditures into eight major groups (seen below), which in turn they divide into more than 200 individual item categories. The BLS currently uses 1982–1984 as the base period.\nFor each of the 200 individual expenditure items, the BLS chooses several hundred very specific examples of that item and looks at the prices of those examples. In figuring out the “breakfast cereal” item under the overall category of “foods and beverages,” the BLS picks several hundred examples of breakfast cereal. One example might be the price of a 24-oz. box of a particular brand of cereal sold at a particular store. The BLS statistically selects specific products and sizes and stores to reflect what people buy and where they shop. The basket of goods in the Consumer Price Index thus consists of about 80,000 products; that is, several hundred specific products in over 200 broad-item categories. Statisticians rotate about one-quarter of these 80,000 specific products of the sample each year, and replace them with a different set of products.\nThe next step is to collect data on prices. Data collectors visit or call about 23,000 stores in 87 urban areas all over the United States every month to collect prices on these 80,000 specific products. The BLS also conducts a survey of 50,000 landlords or tenants to collect information about rents.\nStatisticians then calculate the Consumer Price Index by taking the 80,000 prices of individual products and combining them, using weights (see Figure 8.2) determined by the quantities of these products that people buy and allowing for factors like substitution between goods and quality improvements, into price indices for the 200 or so overall items. Then, the statisticians combine the price indices for the 200 items into an overall Consumer Price Index. According the Consumer Price Index website, there are eight categories that data collectors use:\nThe Eight Major Categories in the Consumer Price Index\n\n\nFood and beverages (breakfast cereal, milk, coffee, chicken, wine, full-service meals, and snacks)\nHousing (renter’s cost of housing, homeowner’s cost of housing, fuel oil, bedroom furniture)\nApparel (men’s shirts and sweaters, women’s dresses, jewelry)\nTransportation (new vehicles, airline fares, gasoline, motor vehicle insurance)\nMedical care (prescription drugs and medical supplies, physicians’ services, eyeglasses and eye care, hospital services)\nRecreation (televisions, cable television, pets and pet products, sports equipment, admissions)\nEducation and communication (college tuition, postage, telephone services, computer software and accessories)\nOther goods and services (tobacco and smoking products, haircuts and other personal services, funeral expenses)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Of the eight categories used to generate the Consumer Price Index, housing is the highest at 42.7%. The next highest category, food and beverage at 15.3%, is less than half the size of housing. Other goods and services, and apparel, are the lowest at 3.4% and 3.3%, respectively. (Source: www.bls.gov/cpi)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.1 The CPI and Core Inflation Index\nImagine if you were driving a company truck across the country- you probably would care about things like the prices of available roadside food and motel rooms as well as the truck’s operating condition. However, the manager of the firm might have different priorities. He would care mostly about the truck’s on-time performance and much less so about the food you were eating and the places you were staying. In other words, the company manager would be paying attention to the firm's production, while ignoring transitory elements that impacted you, but did not affect the company’s bottom line.\nIn a sense, a similar situation occurs with regard to measures of inflation. As we’ve learned, CPI measures prices as they affect everyday household spending. Economists typically calculate a core inflation index by taking the CPI and excluding volatile economic variables. In this way, economists have a better sense of the underlying trends in prices that affect the cost of living.\nExamples of excluded variables include energy and food prices, which can jump around from month to month because of the weather. According to an article by Kent Bernhard, during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a key supply point for the nation’s gasoline was nearly knocked out. Gas prices quickly shot up across the nation, in some places by up to 40 cents a gallon in one day. This was not the cause of an economic policy but rather a short-lived event until the pumps were restored in the region. In this case, the CPI that month would register the change as a cost of living event to households, but the core inflation index would remain unchanged. As a result, the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates would not be influenced. Similarly, droughts can cause world-wide spikes in food prices that, if temporary, do not affect the nation’s economic capability.\nAs former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Ben Bernanke noted in 1999 about the core inflation index, “It provide(s) a better guide to monetary policy than the other indices, since it measures the more persistent underlying inflation rather than transitory influences on the price level.” Bernanke also noted that it helps communicate that the Federal Reserve does not need to respond to every inflationary shock since some price changes are transitory and not part of a structural change in the economy.\nIn sum, both the CPI and the core inflation index are important, but serve different audiences. The CPI helps households understand their overall cost of living from month to month, while the core inflation index is a preferred gauge from which to make important government policy changes.\n\n\n8.2.2 Practical Solutions for the Substitution and the Quality/New Goods Biases\nBy the early 2000s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics was using alternative mathematical methods for calculating the Consumer Price Index, more complicated than just adding up the cost of a fixed basket of goods, to allow for some substitution between goods. It was also updating the basket of goods behind the CPI more frequently, so that it could include new and improved goods more rapidly. For certain products, the BLS was carrying out studies to try to measure the quality improvement. For example, with computers, an economic study can try to adjust for changes in speed, memory, screen size, and other product characteristics, and then calculate the change in price after accounting for these product changes. However, these adjustments are inevitably imperfect, and exactly how to make these adjustments is often a source of controversy among professional economists.\nBy the early 2000s, the substitution bias and quality/new goods bias had been somewhat reduced, so that since then the rise in the CPI probably overstates the true rise in inflation by only about 0.5% per year. Over one or a few years, this is not much. Over a period of a decade or two, even half of a percent per year compounds to a more significant amount. In addition, the CPI tracks prices from physical locations, and not at online sites like Amazon, where prices can be lower.\nWhen measuring inflation (and other economic statistics, too), a tradeoff arises between simplicity and interpretation. If we calculate the inflation rate with a basket of goods that is fixed and unchanging, then the calculation of an inflation rate is straightforward, but the problems of substitution bias and quality/new goods bias will arise. However, when the basket of goods is allowed to shift and evolve to reflect substitution toward lower relative prices, quality improvements, and new goods, the technical details of calculating the inflation rate grow more complex.\n\n\n8.2.3 Additional Price Indices: PPI, GDP Deflator, and More\nThe basket of goods behind the Consumer Price Index represents an average hypothetical U.S. household's consumption, which is to say that it does not exactly capture anyone’s personal experience. When the task is to calculate an average level of inflation, this approach works fine. What if, however, you are concerned about inflation experienced by a certain group, like the elderly, or the poor, or single-parent families with children, or Hispanic-Americans? In specific situations, a price index based on the buying power of the average consumer may not feel quite right.\nThis problem has a straightforward solution. If the Consumer Price Index does not serve the desired purpose, then invent another index, based on a basket of goods appropriate for the group of interest. The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes a number of experimental price indices: some for particular groups like the elderly or the poor, some for different geographic areas, and some for certain broad categories of goods like food or housing.\nThe BLS also calculates several price indices that are not based on baskets of consumer goods. For example, the Producer Price Index (PPI) is based on prices paid for supplies and inputs by producers of goods and services. We can break it down into price indices for different industries, commodities, and stages of processing (like finished goods, intermediate goods, or crude materials for further processing). There is an International Price Index based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported. An Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market. The GDP deflator, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis measures, is a price index that includes all the GDP components (that is, consumption plus investment plus government plus exports minus imports). Unlike the CPI, its baskets are not fixed but re-calculate what that year’s GDP would have been worth using the base-year’s prices. MIT's Billion Prices Project is a more recent alternative attempt to measure prices: economists collect data online from retailers and then put them into an index that they compare to the CPI (Source: http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/).\nWhat’s the best measure of inflation? If one is concerned with the most accurate measure of inflation, one should use the GDP deflator as it picks up the prices of goods and services produced. However, it is not a good measure of the cost of living as it includes prices of many products not purchased by households (for example, aircraft, fire engines, factory buildings, office complexes, and bulldozers). If one wants the most accurate measure of inflation as it impacts households, one should use the CPI, as it only picks up prices of products purchased by households. That is why economists sometimes refer to the CPI as the cost-of-living index. As the Bureau of Labor Statistics states on its website: “The ‘best’ measure of inflation for a given application depends on the intended use of the data.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring price levels with a fixed basket of goods will always have two problems: the substitution bias, by which a fixed basket of goods does not allow for buying more of what becomes relatively less expensive and less of what becomes relatively more expensive; and the quality/new goods bias, by which a fixed basket cannot account for improvements in quality and the advent of new goods.\nThese problems can be reduced in degree—for example, by allowing the basket of goods to evolve over time—but we cannot totally eliminate them. The most commonly cited measure of inflation is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of goods representing what the typical consumer buys.\nThe Core Inflation Index further breaks down the CPI by excluding volatile economic commodities. Several price indices are not based on baskets of consumer goods. The GDP deflator is based on all GDP components.\nThe Producer Price Index is based on prices of supplies and inputs bought by producers of goods and services.\nAn Employment Cost Index measures wage inflation in the labor market. An International Price Index is based on the prices of merchandise that is exported or imported.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Measure Changes in the Cost of Living introduced a number of different price indices. Which price index would be best to use to adjust your paycheck for inflation?\nThe Consumer Price Index is subject to the substitution bias and the quality/new goods bias. Are the Producer Price Index and the GDP Deflator also subject to these biases? Why or why not?\nWhy does “substitution bias” arise if we calculate the inflation rate based on a fixed basket of goods?\nWhy does the “quality/new goods bias” arise if we calculate the inflation rate based on a fixed basket of goods?\nGiven the federal budget deficit in recent years, some economists have argued that by adjusting Social Security payments for inflation using the CPI, Social Security is overpaying recipients. What is their argument, and do you agree or disagree with it?\nWhy is the GDP deflator not an accurate measure of inflation as it impacts a household?\nImagine that the government statisticians who calculate the inflation rate have been updating the basic basket of goods once every 10 years, but now they decide to update it every five years. How will this change affect the amount of substitution bias and quality/new goods bias?\nDescribe a situation, either a government policy situation, an economic problem, or a private sector situation, where using the CPI to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate than using the GDP deflator.\nDescribe a situation, either a government policy situation, an economic problem, or a private sector situation, where using the GDP deflator to convert from nominal to real would be more appropriate than using the CPI.",

Looking back over the twentieth century, there have been several periods where inflation caused the price level to rise at double-digit rates, but nothing has come close to hyperinflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHyperinflation\nWhen the inflation rate exceeds 50% per month, economists usually refer to this as hyperinflation.\n\n\n\n8.3.1 Historical Inflation in the U.S. Economy\n\n\nCode\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ntitleSize = 16\nsns.set_style(\"whitegrid\", {'grid.linestyle': ':'})\n\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n## Load data\ndf_a = pd.read_csv('Graphs/Annual_FRED.csv', header=0, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)\ndf_q = pd.read_csv('Graphs/Quarterly_FRED.csv', header=0, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)\ndf_m = pd.read_csv('Graphs/Monthly_FRED.csv', header=0, index_col=0, parse_dates=True)\n# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ndf_q['ExportsTrill'] = df_q['Exports']/1000000\ndf_q['ImportsTrill'] = df_q['Imports']/1000000\n\ndf_q['GDPTrill'] = df_q['GDP']/1000\ndf_q['GNPTrill'] = df_q['GNP']/1000\ndf_q['realGDPTrill'] = df_q['rGDP']/1000\n\ndf_q['ExportsGDP'] = df_q['Exports']/df_q['GDP']*100\ndf_q['ImportsGDP'] = df_q['Imports']/df_q['GDP']*100\ndf_q['TradeBalance'] = (df_q['Exports']-df_q['Imports'])/df_q['GDP']*100\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_a['CPI_Urban'].plot()\nplt.title('CPI Urban', fontsize=titleSize)\nplt.ylabel('CPI')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Level of prices in the Consumer Price Index stretching back to 1949\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 8.3 the base years (when the CPI is defined as 100) are set for the average level of prices that existed from 1982 to 1984. In 1913, the CPI starts out close to 10, rises to around 20 in 1920, stays around 16 or 17 until 1931, then falls to 13 or 14 until 1940.\nThe graph starts in year 1949. The CPI gradually increases until about 1973, then increases more rapidly through the remainder of the 1970s and beyond, with periodic dips, until 2016, when it reached around 240.\n\n\nCode\n(df_a['CPI_Urban'].pct_change()*100).plot()\nplt.title('Percentage Change in Urban CPI (Inflation)', fontsize=titleSize)\nplt.ylabel('%')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Annual percentage change in Consumer Price Index stretching back to 1949\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4 shows the annual percentage changes in the CPI over time. This is also called the rate of inflation.\nIn 1916, the rate of inflation starts out with inflation at almost 8%, jumps to about 17% in 1917, drops drastically to close to –11% in 1921, goes up and down periodically, with peaks in the 1940s and the 1970s, until settling to around 1.3% in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: These historic time series stretch even further back.\n\n\n\nThe first two waves of inflation are easy to characterize in historical terms: they are right after World War I and World War II. However, there are also two periods of severe negative inflation—called deflation—in the early decades of the twentieth century: one following the deep 1920-21 recession of and the other during the 1930s Great Depression of the 1930s. (Since inflation is a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services is reduced, deflation will be a time when the buying power of money in terms of goods and services increases.)\nFor the period from 1900 to about 1960, the major inflations and deflations nearly balanced each other out, so the average annual rate of inflation over these years was only about 1% per year. A third wave of more severe inflation arrived in the 1970s and departed in the early 1980s.\nTimes of recession or depression often seem to be times when the inflation rate is lower, as in the recession of 1920–1921, the Great Depression, the recession of 1980–1982, and the Great Recession in 2008–2009. There were a few months in 2009 that were deflationary, but not at an annual rate. High levels of unemployment typically accompany recessions, and the total demand for goods falls, pulling the price level down. Conversely, the rate of inflation often, but not always, seems to start moving up when the economy is growing very strongly, like right after wartime or during the 1960s. The frameworks for macroeconomic analysis, that we developed in other chapters, will explain why recession often accompanies higher unemployment and lower inflation, while rapid economic growth often brings lower unemployment but higher inflation.\n\n\n8.3.2 Inflation around the World\nAround the rest of the world, the pattern of inflation has been very mixed; Figure 8.6 shows inflation rates over the last several decades. Many industrialized countries, not just the United States, had relatively high inflation rates in the 1970s.\nFor example, in 1975, Japan’s inflation rate was over 8% and the inflation rate for the United Kingdom was almost 25%. In the 1980s, inflation rates came down in the United States and in Europe and have largely stayed down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: This chart shows the annual percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year’s consumer prices in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany.\n\n\n\nCountries with controlled economies in the 1970s, like the Soviet Union and China, historically had very low rates of measured inflation—because prices were forbidden to rise by law, except for the cases where the government deemed a price increase to be due to quality improvements. However, these countries also had perpetual shortages of goods, since forbidding prices to rise acts like a price ceiling and creates a situation where quantity demanded often exceeds quantity supplied.\nAs Russia and China made a transition toward more market-oriented economies, they also experienced outbursts of inflation, although we should regard the statistics for these economies as somewhat shakier.\nInflation in China averaged about 10% per year for much of the 1980s and early 1990s, although it has dropped off since then. Russia experienced hyperinflation—an outburst of high inflation—of 2,500% per year in the early 1990s, although by 2006 Russia’s consumer price inflation had dipped below 10% per year, as Figure 8.7 shows. The closest the United States has ever reached hyperinflation was during the 1860–1865 Civil War, in the Confederate states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: These charts show the percentage change in consumer prices compared with the previous year’s consumer prices in Brazil, China, and Russia. (a) Of these, Brazil and Russia experienced very high inflation at some point between the late-1980s and late-1990s. (b) Though not as high, China also had high inflation rates in the mid-1990s. Even though their inflation rates have come down over the last two decades, several of these countries continue to see significant inflation rates.

In 1990, for example, both Brazil and Argentina saw inflation climb above 2000%. Certain countries in Africa experienced extremely high rates of inflation, sometimes bordering on hyperinflation, in the 1990s. Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, had an inflation rate of 75% in 1995.\nIn the early 2000s, the problem of inflation appears to have diminished for most countries, at least in comparison to the worst times of recent decades. As we noted in this earlier Bring it Home feature, in recent years, the world’s worst example of hyperinflation was in Zimbabwe, where at one point the government was issuing bills with a face value of $100 trillion (in Zimbabwean dollars)—that is, the bills had $100,000,000,000,000 written on the front, but were almost worthless. In many countries, the memory of double-digit, triple-digit, and even quadruple-digit inflation is not very far in the past.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nIn the U.S. economy, the annual inflation rate in the last two decades has typically been around 2% to 4%. The periods of highest inflation in the United States in the twentieth century occurred during the years after World Wars I and II, and in the 1970s. The period of lowest inflation—actually, with deflation—was the 1930s Great Depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to this website for the Purchasing Power Calculator at MeasuringWorth.com.

Robert Shiller, one of 2013’s Nobel Prize winners in economics, carried out several surveys during the 1990s about attitudes toward inflation. One of his questions asked, “Do you agree that preventing high inflation is an important national priority, as important as preventing drug abuse or preventing deterioration in the quality of our schools?” Answers were on a scale of 1–5, where 1 meant “Fully agree” and 5 meant “Completely disagree.” For the U.S. population as a whole, 52% answered “Fully agree” that preventing high inflation was a highly important national priority and just 4% said “Completely disagree.” However, among professional economists, only 18% answered “Fully agree,” while the same percentage of 18% answered “Completely disagree.”\n\n8.4.1 The Land of Funny Money\nWhat are the economic problems caused by inflation, and why do economists often regard them with less concern than the general public? Consider a very short story: “The Land of Funny Money.”\nOne morning, everyone in the Land of Funny Money awakened to find that everything denominated in money had increased by 20%. The change was completely unexpected. Every price in every store was 20% higher. Paychecks were 20% higher. Interest rates were 20 % higher. The amount of money, everywhere from wallets to savings accounts, was 20% larger. This overnight inflation of prices made newspaper headlines everywhere in the Land of Funny Money. However, the headlines quickly disappeared, as people realized that in terms of what they could actually buy with their incomes, this inflation had no economic impact. Everyone’s pay could still buy exactly the same set of goods as it did before. Everyone’s savings were still sufficient to buy exactly the same car, vacation, or retirement that they could have bought before. Equal levels of inflation in all wages and prices ended up not mattering much at all.\nWhen the people in Robert Shiller’s surveys explained their concern about inflation, one typical reason was that they feared that as prices rose, they would not be able to afford to buy as much. In other words, people were worried because they did not live in a place like the Land of Funny Money, where all prices and wages rose simultaneously. Instead, people live here on Planet Earth, where prices might rise while wages do not rise at all, or where wages rise more slowly than prices.\nEconomists note that over most periods, the inflation level in prices is roughly similar to the inflation level in wages, and so they reason that, on average, over time, people’s economic status is not greatly changed by inflation. If all prices, wages, and interest rates adjusted automatically and immediately with inflation, as in the Land of Funny Money, then no one’s purchasing power, profits, or real loan payments would change. However, if other economic variables do not move exactly in sync with inflation, or if they adjust for inflation only after a time lag, then inflation can cause three types of problems: unintended redistributions of purchasing power, blurred price signals, and difficulties in long-term planning.\n\n\n8.4.2 Unintended Redistributions of Purchasing Power\nInflation can cause redistributions of purchasing power that hurt some and help others. People who are hurt by inflation include those who are holding considerable cash, whether it is in a safe deposit box or in a cardboard box under the bed. When inflation happens, the buying power of cash diminishes. However, cash is only an example of a more general problem: anyone who has financial assets invested in a way that the nominal return does not keep up with inflation will tend to suffer from inflation. For example, if a person has money in a bank account that pays 4% interest, but inflation rises to 5%, then the real rate of return for the money invested in that bank account is negative 1%.\nThe problem of a good-looking nominal interest rate transforming into an ugly-looking real interest rate can be worsened by taxes. The U.S. income tax is charged on the nominal interest received in dollar terms, without an adjustment for inflation. Thus, the government taxes a person who invests $10,000 and receives a 5% nominal rate of interest on the $500 received—no matter whether the inflation rate is 0%, 5%, or 10%. If inflation is 0%, then the real interest rate is 5% and all $500 is a gain in buying power. However, if inflation is 5%, then the real interest rate is zero and the person had no real gain—but owes income tax on the nominal gain anyway. If inflation is 10%, then the real interest rate is negative 5% and the person is actually falling behind in buying power, but would still owe taxes on the $500 in nominal gains.\nInflation can cause unintended redistributions for wage earners, too. Wages do typically creep up with inflation over time, eventually. The last row of [link] at the start of this chapter showed that the average hourly wage in manufacturing in the U.S. economy increased from $3.23 in 1970 to $20.65 in 2017, which is an increase by a factor of more than six. Over that time period, the Consumer Price Index increased by an almost identical amount.\nHowever, increases in wages may lag behind inflation for a year or two, since wage adjustments are often somewhat sticky and occur only once or twice a year. Moreover, the extent to which wages keep up with inflation creates insecurity for workers and may involve painful, prolonged conflicts between employers and employees. If the government adjusts minimum wage for inflation only infrequently, minimum wage workers are losing purchasing power from their nominal wages, as Figure 8.8 shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: After adjusting for inflation, the federal minimum wage dropped more than 30 percent from 1967 to 2010, even though the nominal figure climbed from $1.40 to $7.25 per hour. Increases in the minimum wage in between 2008 and 2010 kept the decline from being worse—as it would have been if the wage had remained the same as it did from 1997 through 2007. Since 2010, the real minimum wage has continued to decline. (Sources: http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/chart.htm; http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?cu)\n\n\n\nOne sizable group of people has often received a large share of their income in a form that does not increase over time: retirees who receive a private company pension. Most pensions have traditionally been set as a fixed nominal dollar amount per year at retirement. For this reason, economists call pensions “defined benefits” plans. Even if inflation is low, the combination of inflation and a fixed income can create a substantial problem over time. A person who retires on a fixed income at age 65 will find that losing just 1% to 2% of buying power per year to inflation compounds to a considerable loss of buying power after a decade or two.\nFortunately, pensions and other defined benefits retirement plans are increasingly rare, replaced instead by “defined contribution” plans, such as 401(k)s and 403(b)s. In these plans, the employer contributes a fixed amount to the worker’s retirement account on a regular basis (usually every pay check). The employee often contributes as well. The worker invests these funds in a wide range of investment vehicles. These plans are tax deferred, and they are portable so that if the individual takes a job with a different employer, their 401(k) comes with them. To the extent that the investments made generate real rates of return, retirees do not suffer from the inflation costs of traditional pensioners.\nHowever, ordinary people can sometimes benefit from the unintended redistributions of inflation. Consider someone who borrows $10,000 to buy a car at a fixed interest rate of 9%. If inflation is 3% at the time the loan is made, then he or she must repay the loan at a real interest rate of 6%. However, if inflation rises to 9%, then the real interest rate on the loan is zero. In this case, the borrower’s benefit from inflation is the lender’s loss. A borrower paying a fixed interest rate, who benefits from inflation, is just the flip side of an investor receiving a fixed interest rate, who suffers from inflation. The lesson is that when interest rates are fixed, rises in the rate of inflation tend to penalize suppliers of financial capital, who receive repayment in dollars that are worth less because of inflation, while demanders of financial capital end up better off, because they can repay their loans in dollars that are worth less than originally expected.\nThe unintended redistributions of buying power that inflation causes may have a broader effect on society. America’s widespread acceptance of market forces rests on a perception that people’s actions have a reasonable connection to market outcomes. When inflation causes a retiree who built up a pension or invested at a fixed interest rate to suffer, however, while someone who borrowed at a fixed interest rate benefits from inflation, it is hard to believe that this outcome was deserved in any way. Similarly, when homeowners benefit from inflation because the price of their homes rises, while renters suffer because they are paying higher rent, it is hard to see any useful incentive effects. One of the reasons that the general public dislikes inflation is a sense that it makes economic rewards and penalties more arbitrary—and therefore likely to be perceived as unfair – even dangerous, as the next Clear It Up feature shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIS THERE A CONNECTION BETWEEN GERMAN HYPERINFLATION AND HITLER’S RISE TO POWER?\nGermany suffered an intense hyperinflation of its currency, the Mark, in the years after World War I, when the Weimar Republic in Germany resorted to printing money to pay its bills and the onset of the Great Depression created the social turmoil that Adolf Hitler was able to take advantage of in his rise to power. Shiller described the connection this way in a National Bureau of Economic Research 1996 Working Paper:\nA fact that is probably little known to young people today, even in Germany, is that the final collapse of the Mark in 1923, the time when the Mark’s inflation reached astronomical levels (inflation of 35,974.9% in November 1923 alone, for an annual rate that month of 4.69 × 1028%), came in the same month as did Hitler’s Beer Hall Putsch, his Nazi Party’s armed attempt to overthrow the German government. This failed putsch resulted in Hitler’s imprisonment, at which time he wrote his book Mein Kampf, setting forth an inspirational plan for Germany’s future, suggesting plans for world domination. . . . . . Most people in Germany today probably do not clearly remember these events; this lack of attention to it may be because its memory is blurred by the more dramatic events that succeeded it (the Nazi seizure of power and World War II). However, to someone living through these historical events in sequence . . . [the putsch] may have been remembered as vivid evidence of the potential effects of inflation.\n\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Blurred Price Signals\nPrices are the messengers in a market economy, conveying information about conditions of demand and supply. Inflation blurs those price messages. Inflation means that we perceive price signals more vaguely, like a radio program received with considerable static. If the static becomes severe, it is hard to tell what is happening.\nIn Israel, when inflation accelerated to an annual rate of 500% in 1985, some stores stopped posting prices directly on items, since they would have had to put new labels on the items or shelves every few days to reflect inflation. Instead, a shopper just took items from a shelf and went up to the checkout register to find out the price for that day. Obviously, this situation makes comparing prices and shopping for the best deal rather difficult. When the levels and changes of prices become uncertain, businesses and individuals find it harder to react to economic signals. In a world where inflation is at a high rate, but bouncing up and down to some extent, does a higher price of a good mean that inflation has risen, or that supply of that good has decreased, or that demand for that good has increased? Should a buyer of the good take the higher prices as an economic hint to start substituting other products—or have the prices of the substitutes risen by an equal amount? Should a seller of the good take a higher price as a reason to increase production—or is the higher price only a sign of a general inflation in which the prices of all inputs to production are rising as well? The true story will presumably become clear over time, but at a given moment, who can say?\nHigh and variable inflation means that the incentives in the economy to adjust in response to changes in prices are weaker. Markets will adjust toward their equilibrium prices and quantities more erratically and slowly, and many individual markets will experience a greater chance of surpluses and shortages.\n\n\n8.4.4 Problems of Long-Term Planning\nInflation can make long-term planning difficult. In discussing unintended redistributions, we considered the case of someone trying to plan for retirement with a pension that is fixed in nominal terms and a high rate of inflation. Similar problems arise for all people trying to save for retirement, because they must consider what their money will really buy several decades in the future when we cannot know the rate of future inflation.\nInflation, especially at moderate or high levels, will pose substantial planning problems for businesses, too. A firm can make money from inflation—for example, by paying bills and wages as late as possible so that it can pay in inflated dollars, while collecting revenues as soon as possible. A firm can also suffer losses from inflation, as in the case of a retail business that gets stuck holding too much cash, only to see inflation eroding the value of that cash. However, when a business spends its time focusing on how to profit by inflation, or at least how to avoid suffering from it, an inevitable tradeoff strikes: less time is spent on improving products and services or on figuring out how to make existing products and services more cheaply. An economy with high inflation rewards businesses that have found clever ways of profiting from inflation, which are not necessarily the businesses that excel at productivity, innovation, or quality of service.\nIn the short term, low or moderate levels of inflation may not pose an overwhelming difficulty for business planning, because costs of doing business and sales revenues may rise at similar rates. If, however, inflation varies substantially over the short or medium term, then it may make sense for businesses to stick to shorter-term strategies. The evidence as to whether relatively low rates of inflation reduce productivity is controversial among economists. There is some evidence that if inflation can be held to moderate levels of less than 3% per year, it need not prevent a nation’s real economy from growing at a healthy pace.\nFor some countries that have experienced hyperinflation of several thousand percent per year, an annual inflation rate of 20–30% may feel basically the same as zero. However, several economists have pointed to the suggestive fact that when U.S. inflation heated up in the early 1970s—to 10%—U.S. growth in productivity slowed down, and when inflation slowed down in the 1980s, productivity edged up again not long thereafter, as Figure 8.9 shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: Over the last several decades in the United States, there have been times when rising inflation rates have been closely followed by lower productivity rates and lower inflation rates have corresponded to increasing productivity rates. As the graph shows, however, this correlation does not always exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.5 Any Benefits of Inflation?\nAlthough the economic effects of inflation are primarily negative, two countervailing points are worth noting. First, the impact of inflation will differ considerably according to whether it is creeping up slowly at 0% to 2% per year, galloping along at 10% to 20% per year, or racing to the point of hyperinflation at, say, 40% per month. Hyperinflation can rip an economy and a society apart. An annual inflation rate of 2%, 3%, or 4%, however, is a long way from a national crisis. Low inflation is also better than deflation which occurs with severe recessions.\nSecond, economists sometimes argue that moderate inflation may help the economy by making wages in labor markets more flexible. The discussion in Unemployment pointed out that wages tend to be sticky in their downward movements and that unemployment can result. A little inflation could nibble away at real wages, and thus help real wages to decline if necessary. In this way, even if a moderate or high rate of inflation may act as sand in the gears of the economy, perhaps a low rate of inflation serves as oil for the gears of the labor market. This argument is controversial. A full analysis would have to account for all the effects of inflation. It does, however, offer another reason to believe that, all things considered, very low rates of inflation may not be especially harmful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nUnexpected inflation will tend to hurt those whose money received, in terms of wages and interest payments, does not rise with inflation. In contrast, inflation can help those who owe money that they can pay in less valuable, inflated dollars.\nLow rates of inflation have relatively little economic impact over the short term. Over the medium and the long term, even low rates of inflation can complicate future planning.\nHigh rates of inflation can muddle price signals in the short term and prevent market forces from operating efficiently, and can vastly complicate long-term savings and investment decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf inflation rises unexpectedly by 5%, would a state government that had recently borrowed money to pay for a new highway benefit or lose?\nIdentify several parties likely to be helped and hurt by inflation.\nIf, over time, wages and salaries on average rise at least as fast as inflation, why do people worry about how inflation affects incomes?\nWho in an economy is the big winner from inflation?",

    "text": "8.5 Indexing and Its Limitations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the relationship between indexing and inflation\nIdentify three ways the government can control inflation through macroeconomic policy\n\n\n\nWhen a price, wage, or interest rate is adjusted automatically with inflation, economists use the term indexed. An indexed payment increases according to the index number that measures inflation. Those in private markets and government programs observe a wide range of indexing arrangements. Since the negative effects of inflation depend in large part on having inflation unexpectedly affect one part of the economy but not another—say, increasing the prices that people pay but not the wages that workers receive—indexing will take some of the sting out of inflation.\n\n8.5.1 Indexing in Private Markets\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, labor unions commonly negotiated wage contracts that had cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) which guaranteed that their wages would keep up with inflation. These contracts were sometimes written as, for example, COLA plus 3%. Thus, if inflation was 5%, the wage increase would automatically be 8%, but if inflation rose to 9%, the wage increase would automatically be 12%. COLAs are a form of indexing applied to wages.\nLoans often have built-in inflation adjustments, too, so that if the inflation rate rises by two percentage points, then the interest rate that a financial institution charges on the loan rises by two percentage points as well. An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of loan that one can use to purchase a home in which the interest rate varies with the rate of inflation. Often, a borrower will be able receive a lower interest rate if borrowing with an ARM, compared to a fixed-rate loan. The reason is that with an ARM, the lender is protected against the risk that higher inflation will reduce the real loan payments, and so the risk premium part of the interest rate can be correspondingly lower.\nA number of ongoing or long-term business contracts also have provisions that prices will adjust automatically according to inflation. Sellers like such contracts because they are not locked into a low nominal selling price if inflation turns out higher than expected. Buyers like such contracts because they are not locked into a high buying price if inflation turns out to be lower than expected. A contract with automatic adjustments for inflation in effect agrees on a real price for the borrower to pay, rather than a nominal price.\n\n\n8.5.2 Indexing in Government Programs\nMany government programs are indexed to inflation. The U.S. income tax code is designed so that as a person’s income rises above certain levels, the tax rate on the marginal income earned rises as well. That is what the expression “move into a higher tax bracket” means. For example, according to the basic tax tables from the Internal Revenue Service, in 2017 a single person owed 10% of all taxable income from $0 to $9,325; 15% of all income from $9,326 to $37,950; 25% of all taxable income from $37,951 to $91,900; 28% of all taxable income from $91,901 to $191,650; 33% of all taxable income from $191,651 to $416,700; 35% of all taxable income from $416,701 to $418,400; and 39.6% of all income from $418,401 and above.\nBecause of the many complex provisions in the rest of the tax code, it is difficult to determine exactly the taxes an individual owes the government based on these numbers, but the numbers illustrate the basic theme that tax rates rise as the marginal dollar of income rises. Until the late 1970s, if nominal wages increased along with inflation, people were moved into higher tax brackets and owed a higher proportion of their income in taxes, even though their real income had not risen. In 1981, the government eliminated this “bracket creep”. Now, the income levels where higher tax rates kick in are indexed to rise automatically with inflation.\nThe Social Security program offers two examples of indexing. Since the passage of the Social Security Indexing Act of 1972, the level of Social Security benefits increases each year along with the Consumer Price Index. Also, Social Security is funded by payroll taxes, which the government imposes on the income earned up to a certain amount—$117,000 in 2014. The government adjusts this level of income upward each year according to the rate of inflation, so that an indexed increase in the Social Security tax base accompanies the indexed rise in the benefit level.\nAs yet another example of a government program affected by indexing, in 1996 the U.S., government began offering indexed bonds. Bonds are means by which the U.S. government (and many private-sector companies as well) borrows money; that is, investors buy the bonds, and then the government repays the money with interest. Traditionally, government bonds have paid a fixed rate of interest. This policy gave a government that had borrowed an incentive to encourage inflation, because it could then repay its past borrowing in inflated dollars at a lower real interest rate. However, indexed bonds promise to pay a certain real rate of interest above whatever inflation rate occurs. In the case of a retiree trying to plan for the long term and worried about the risk of inflation, for example, indexed bonds that guarantee a rate of return higher than inflation—no matter the level of inflation—can be a very comforting investment.\n\n\n8.5.3 Might Indexing Reduce Concern over Inflation?\nIndexing may seem like an obviously useful step. After all, when individuals, firms, and government programs are indexed against inflation, then people can worry less about arbitrary redistributions and other effects of inflation.\nHowever, some of the fiercest opponents of inflation express grave concern about indexing. They point out that indexing is always partial. Not every employer will provide COLAs for workers. Not all companies can assume that costs and revenues will rise in lockstep with the general rates of inflation. Not all interest rates for borrowers and savers will change to match inflation exactly. However, as partial inflation indexing spreads, the political opposition to inflation may diminish. After all, older people whose Social Security benefits are protected against inflation, or banks that have loaned their money with adjustable-rate loans, no longer have as much reason to care whether inflation heats up. In a world where some people are indexed against inflation and some are not, financially savvy businesses and investors may seek out ways to be protected against inflation, while the financially unsophisticated and small businesses may suffer from it most.\n\n\n8.5.4 A Preview of Policy Discussions of Inflation\nThis chapter has focused on how economists measure inflation, historical experience with inflation, how to adjust nominal variables into real ones, how inflation affects the economy, and how indexing works. We have barely hinted at the causes of inflation, and we have not addressed government policies to deal with inflation. We will examine these issues in depth in other chapters. However, it is useful to offer a preview here.\nWe can sum up the cause of inflation in one phrase: Too many dollars chasing too few goods. The great surges of inflation early in the twentieth century came after wars, which are a time when government spending is very high, but consumers have little to buy, because production is going to the war effort. Governments also commonly impose price controls during wartime. After the war, the price controls end and pent-up buying power surges forth, driving up inflation. Otherwise, if too few dollars are chasing too many goods, then inflation will decline or even turn into deflation. Therefore, we typically associate slowdowns in economic activity, as in major recessions and the Great Depression, with a reduction in inflation or even outright deflation.\nThe policy implications are clear. If we are to avoid inflation, the amount of purchasing power in the economy must grow at roughly the same rate as the production of goods. Macroeconomic policies that the government can use to affect the amount of purchasing power—through taxes, spending, and regulation of interest rates and credit—can thus cause inflation to rise or reduce inflation to lower levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA $550 MILLION LOAF OF BREAD?\nAs we will learn in Money and Banking, the existence of money provides enormous benefits to an economy. In a real sense, money is the lubrication that enhances the workings of markets. Money makes transactions easier. It allows people to find employment producing one product, then use the money earned to purchase the other products they need to live. However, too much money in circulation can lead to inflation. Extreme cases of governments recklessly printing money lead to hyperinflation.\nInflation reduces the value of money. Hyperinflation, because money loses value so quickly, ultimately results in people no longer using money. The economy reverts to barter, or it adopts another country’s more stable currency, like U.S. dollars. In the meantime, the economy literally falls apart as people leave jobs and fend for themselves because it is not worth the time to work for money that will be worthless in a few days.\nOnly national governments have the power to cause hyperinflation. Hyperinflation typically happens when government faces extraordinary demands for spending, which it cannot finance by taxes or borrowing. The only option is to print money—more and more of it. With more money in circulation chasing the same amount (or even fewer) goods and services, the only result is increasingly higher prices until the economy and/or the government collapses. This is why economists are generally wary of letting inflation spiral out of control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nA payment is indexed if it is automatically adjusted for inflation. Examples of indexing in the private sector include wage contracts with cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) and loan agreements like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Examples of indexing in the public sector include tax brackets and Social Security payments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow should an increase in inflation affect the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage?\nA fixed-rate mortgage has the same interest rate over the life of the loan, whether the mortgage is for 15 or 30 years. By contrast, an adjustable-rate mortgage changes with market interest rates over the life of the mortgage. If inflation falls unexpectedly by 3%, what would likely happen to a homeowner with an adjustable-rate mortgage?\nWhat is indexing?\nName several forms of indexing in the private and public sector.\nIf a government gains from unexpected inflation when it borrows, why would it choose to offer indexed bonds?\nDo you think perfect indexing is possible? Why or why not?",

Remember, in the long-run prices can fully adjust to market conditions.\nClassical economist believed that there are strong forces pushing the economy back to full employment after unemployment shocks occurred. As equilibrium is reached in the long-run, booms or busts are therefore only temporary.\n\n\nThey are business cycle issues\nWe can just \"wait it out\" as the markets adjust and move the economy back to full-employment. In a classical economist's view there is only a very limited role for government (i.e., ensuring property rights, national defense, providing some public goods).\n\n\nActive fiscal policy---where the government tries to actively affect the business cycle (i.e., the ups and downs of GDP over time) through tax and spending policies---is often criticized by economists of the classical tradition as doing more harm than good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn summary Classical Economics is long-run focused and\n\nWages and prices adjust freely and quickly to all changes in demand and supply.\nHence, we call this the long-run analysis.\nMarkets adjust freely.\nMinor role for Government.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Keynesian Analysis: Short-Run\nKeynes does not care about the long-run. His famous quote states: “In the long-run we are all dead.” The focus on the long-run that classical economists embrace, seems misguided if workers have trouble finding jobs right now.\nKeynes therefore advocates an active fiscal policy and a focus on the short-run. In the short prices and wages seem to be “sticky”. Government intervention needed to adjust the econosmy back to equilibrium. According to Keynes we cannot afford to wait for the “long-run” where markets fix everything automatically through appropriate prices adjustments (as advocated by the classical school).\nIf the economy is in a slump, is there anything the government can do? Keynes' answer is yes. It typically involves fiscal policy, i.e., cutting taxes or increasing government spending or a combination of both. This type of policy is often referred to as deficit spending as cutting taxes and/or increasing the spending of government will invariably increase the deficit.\nAn important concept in discussing short-run and long-run effects is understanding the concept of Full Employment. An economy is at full employment when cyclical unemployement is zero (go back and read the chapter on the various types of unemployment again). This does not mean that everybody in the labor force is employed. We can still observe frictional and structural unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nNeoclassical anlaysis focuses on the long-run where all prices are fully flexible to adjust and where markets reach equilibrium allocations automatically through market forces and the resulting price adjustments.\nKeynesian analysis focuses on the short-run where prices are sticky. It advocates for an active role of government in an attempt to smooth out the business cycle and reduce unemployment.\nFull employment The economy is experiencing neither a boom nor a bust and there is zero cyclical unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn economist advocates for a tax cut during a recession.

    "text": "9.2 Production Technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nRepresentative firm\nProduction function\nDecreasing returns to scale\nConstant returns to scale\n\n\n\nHow Much Does the Economy Produce? Production is typically measured using a production function. A production unit (or firm) produces goods and servies using input factors such as labor, capital, raw materials, land, etc.\nThe productivity of these inputs (or the effectiveness of the usage of input factors) depends on the level of technology in the economy which is referred to as total factor productivity or TFP.\n\n9.2.1 The Representative Firm\nIn a macroeconomic model we often operate at the aggregate level. We assume that the economy is populated by countless smaller firms that are all identical in their basic makeup, i.e., they use capital and labor as input factors and produce an identical final good/service. This allows us to \"add them all up\" into a representative aggregate production unit or a representative firm.\nThis firm demands labor (\\(N^d\\)) and capital (\\(K\\)) in factor markets and pays a wage and an interest rate as compensation to the owners of labor and capital.\nThe choice of the firm about how much to produce is determined by its technology and a profit maximization motive. How much a firm is able to produce depends on the firm's total factor productivity \\(A\\) (think of this as the level of technology that is available to the firm) and the quantity of input factors such as capital \\(K\\) and labor \\(N^d\\). Formally, this can be written as the following production function:\n\\[Y=A \\times F(K,N_{d}),\\]\nwhere A is the total factor productivity (TFP) which is a measure of overall effectiveness or technology!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere is an example of a very specific production function:\n\\[Y= 10 \\times K^\\alpha \\times N_{d}^{(1-\\alpha)}.\\]\nThe greek letter \\(\\alpha\\) is the factor share of capital in production and \\(1-\\alpha\\) is the factor share of labor in production. It is basically a factor that tells you how important capital is in relation to labor when producing output.\nLet us assume that \\(\\alpha = 0.3\\) and the firm uses 20 units of capital and 15 units of labor, then output would be:\n\\[Y= 10 \\times 20^{0.3} \\times 15^{(1-0.3)} = 163.5207536.\\]\n\n\nOne of the properties of a typical production function in macroeconomics is diminishing returns to scale in factor inputs. This means that as a firm employs more and more of an input factor, while NOT increasing the other input factors, the output will increase BUT at a decreasing rate.\nFigure 9.1 shows an example of diminishing (or decreasing) returns to scale in a production function where capital is fixed at a certain amount of capital \\(\\overline{K}\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Production function with labor input and capital held constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 9.1: Diminishing Returns\n\n\n\n\n\nY (Output)\n\\(N_d\\) (labor input)\nAdditional Output (MPN)\n\n\n\n\n1,000\n1\n1,000\n\n\n1,500\n2\n500\n\n\n1,900\n3\n400\n\n\n2,200\n4\n300\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Table 9.1 you see that with this production function every additional labor unit produces less additional output than the previous labor unit. The first labor unit produces 1,000 units of output. The second labor unit that you add produces an additional 500 units for a total of 1,500 units. The third labor unit that you add produces an additional 400 units for a total of 1,900 units (with 3 workers employed). The fourth produces an additional 300 units. You see that the \"additional units\" you get keep decreasing, hence the name diminishing returns to scale if the capital input is held fixed!\nThe additional output is referred to as marginal product of labor or MPN. The additional output is decreasing as the firm hires more labor but keeps the amount of capital constant.\nIf, on the other hand, capital increases as well, then every unit of labor is producing more than before the capital increase. Figure 9.2 shows this case.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Production function with labor input and capital held constant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nReturns to Scale Concepts\n\nAs previously discussed, a standard production function in macroeconomics typically exhibits decreasing returns to scale (DRS) IF one of the input factors is held constant.\nA production function exihibits constant returns to scale (CRS) if, an increase in ALL of the input factors increases output at the same ratio.\n\n\n\nSo for example, if both labor and capital are doubled, then output will double as well. The concept of CRS embeds the notion of perfect reproduceability of a production unit, or perfect replication (or cloning) of a firm is assumed to be possible.\nMore formally a production function exhibits CRS if:\n\\[n \\times Y=A\\times F(n\\times K,\\mbox{ }n\\times N^{d})\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHere is an example\nIf n=2 then, if the production function is CRS, a doubling of ALL the input factors \\((2\\times K)\\) and \\((2\\times N^{d})\\) results in\n\\[2\\times Y=A\\times F(2\\times K,\\mbox{ }2\\times N^{d})\\]\na doubling of the output.\n\n\nAn often used function form in macroeconomics is the Cobb-Douglas production function:\n\\[Y=A\\times K^{\\alpha}\\times N^{1-\\alpha}\\]\nwhere the parameter \\(\\alpha\\) measures the share of total income spent on capital and \\((1-\\alpha)\\) measures the share of total income spent on labor input. Estimates from empirical studies have found that for the U.S. economy \\(\\alpha\\) is around \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\nThis is how the production function would then be written:\n\\[Y=A\\times K^{0.3}\\times N^{0.7}\\]\nNow, double all inputs, what happens to output?\n\\[Y_{new}=A\\times\\left(2\\times K\\right)^{0.3}\\times\\left(2\\times N\\right)^{0.7},\\]\\[\\rightarrow Y_{new}=2^{0.3}\\times2^{0.7}\\times\\left[A\\times K^{0.3}\\times N^{0.7}\\right],\\]\\[\\rightarrow Y_{new}=2^{\\left(0.3+0.7\\right)}\\times Y=2\\times Y.\\]\nAs you can see, output has doubled as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\nThe Properties of the production function \\(Y=A\\times F(K, N^{d})\\) include:\n\nOutput is increasing in its inputs, or: Y ↑ when either Nd ↑ or K ↑ or both\nThe marginal product of labor decrease (MPL ↓) when labor input increases (Nd ↑) The MPL is the extra output that can be generated with an additional unit of labor.

Check again the discussion of diminishing returns to scale.\nThe marginal product of capital decrease (MPK ↓) when the capital input increases (K ↑)\nThe marginal product of labor increases (MPL ↑) when the input of captial increases (K ↑).

    "text": "9.3 Labor Markets\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nDemand and supply of labor\nTaxes on labor\nBusiness cycle\n\n\n\nThe amount of employment in an economy is determined by the demand and supply for labor. Firms demand labor, households supply labor. The amount of labor firms will hire depends on the real wage that firms have to pay for a labor unit (typically a work hour).\n\n9.3.1 Wages and the Demand and Supply for Labor\nThe nominal wage rate paid to employees adjusted for changes in the price level. To understand the demand for labor, we use the marginal principle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe marginal principle states that an economic activity is done up to the point where the marginal benefit of the activity is equal to the marginal cost that the activity cause. MB = MC.\n\n\nThe supply of labor is based on the decisions of workers. Changes in real wages have two different effects on the work-leisure trade-off:\n\n\nSubstitution effect: a higher real wage causes workers to substitute work for leisure, so they work more hours.\nIncome effect: a higher real wage rate increases real income, thus workers can afford to have more leisure time, so they work fewer hours.\n\n\nBoth effects work in opposite directions!\nWe typically assume (and it is empirically shown) that the substitution effect dominates the income effect which means that higher wages lead to more supply of labor. With this assumption in place, we can draw and upward sloping labor supply curve in a labor market graph. Figure 9.3 shows a labor demand and labor supply graph as well as a graph that depicts the labor market equilibrium at the equilibrium wage rate of $15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: Labor Market Equilibrium\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Labor Market Equilibrium\nHow would an increase in the stock of capital (i.e., machines, factories) affect the labor demand?\n\nLabor demand would shift to the right. Workers become more productive as more machines become available. Firms, with profit maximization in mind, would have an incentive to hire more workers for any given market wage rate than before the increase in capital.\nThe increase in the demand for labor, a right shift, would increase the total hours worked and increase the real wage rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAs long as full employment can be maintained, workers prefer a high capital stock as they then benefit from higher real wages.\nThis is not a story about machines replacing workers. This is a story of machines making workers more productive and hence workers will experience an increase in their real wage.\n\n\nHow would an increase in immigration affect the labor supply?\n\nIt would lead to a right shift in the labor supply. For any given market wage, more labor hours would be supplied due to the increase in the number of potential workers.\nThe new equilibrium would should an increase in the total hours worked and a decrease in the real wage rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4: Wages and the Demand and Supply for Labor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBlack Death in England\nAccording to the research of Gregory Clark of the UC, Davis, the level of real wages for laborers in England was nearly the same in 1200 as it was in 1800. Yet, during the period from 1350 to 1550, they were higher—nearly 75 percent higher in 1450, for instance, than in 1200. Why were real wages temporarily so high during this period?\nThe simple answer was the bubonic plague—also known as the Black Death. Arrived from Asia in 1348 and caused a long decline in total population through the 1450s. With fewer workers, there was less labor supplied to the market. The result was higher real wages.\nIn the era before consistent and rapid technological advance, changes in population was the primary factor controlling living standards. As the economist Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) observed, social maladies such as the Black Death would temporarily raise living standards until higher living standards led to increased population.\n\n\nThe demand and supply of labor determine the real wage, \\(W^*\\), and identify the level of employment, \\(L^*\\). That level of employment is used to determine the level of output \\(Y^*\\).\nFull-employment output \\(Y^*\\) is the level of output that is produced when the labor market is in equilibrium. It is also known as potential output or long-run output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: Full employment equilibrium and full employment output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nAt full-employment the cyclical unemployment rate is zero. There is still the frictional and structural unemployment rate present. The unemployment that is still present when the economy is at full-employment is referred to as the natural rate of unemployement. It is estimated that the natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. is around 4% - 5.5%.\nSo at full-employment in the U.S. we still observe an unemployment rate of about 4%!\n\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Taxes on Labor\nLabor supply in U.S. is close to vertical! This means that labor supply is very inelastic. Inelastic means, that labor supply does not respond strongly to changes in the wage rates in the aggregate. An increase in the wage rate will not entice people to work a whole lot more hours while a decrease in the wage rate will also not cause a large decrease in work hours supplied by households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Laffer Curve depicts the relationship between the income tax rate on the horizontal axes and government tax revenue on the vertical axis. The relationship is hump shaped. If taxes are very low and taxes increase then so does tax revenue.\nHowever, there will be a point after which a further tax increase is so detrimental to workers incentive to work, that workers will drop out of the labor force and stop working due to high taxes. As a consequence the tax base will shrink, so that despite the higher tax rate, less tax can be collected by the government and tax revenue declines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6: Laffer Curve\n\n\n\nEstimating the peak of the Laffer curve is very difficult. It is different for every tax and depends on the structure of the economy as well as the institutions (economic and political) of a country. For instance, the labor supply response to an increase in the labor tax rate for instance would depend on the elasticity of labor supply to the net wage rate i.e. how responsive workers would be to changes in net wage on average. This average elasticity number depends on many factors such as: sector composition of an economy, perceptions of fairness of workers, worker representation, political climate, etc.\nAn estimate of the Laffer curve for the US from 2011 found that the optimal tax rate is around 73 percent. See: Diamond, Peter, and Emmanuel Saez. 2011. \"The Case for a Progressive Tax: From Basic Research to Policy Recommendations.\" Journal of Economic Perspectives, 25 (4): 165-90. DOI: 10.1257/jep.25.4.165\n\n\nAn often heard argument is that lowering the tax rate would increase tax revenue. This is, at least in theory true, if an economy happens to be currently on the right side of the \"hump\" of the Laffer curve. If you are to the right of the hump, then a tax cut, can increase tax revenue.\nHowever, this story usually requires that a tax cut will stimulate more work. Since we just learned earlier that in the U.S. the labor supply is very steep, a tax cut will not increase labor a whole lot.\nHave a look at the secon panel of Figure 9.7. Changes in labor demand due to changes in the tax rate are not going to affect the equlibrium quantity of labor supplied. So the Laffer curve argument does not really work for income taxes in the U.S.\nIt might work for capital gains taxes though as capital supply is much more elastic, that is responsive to how much capital is taxed!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Tax on labor decreases labor demand. If labor supply is inelastic (right panel), then equilibrium quantity of labor is not affected by a tax increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe Laffer curve is a relationship between tax rate and tax revenues that illustrates how higher tax rates may not always lead to higher tax revenues if the high tax rates discourage economic activity\nThe labor supply curve is not sufficiently flat for Laffer’s idea to work\nFor certain types of taxes, such as\n\nincome and\npayroll taxes,\n\nthere is a danger that cutting tax rates would simply reduce tax revenue because labor supply is not stimulated enough to widen the tax base to compensate for the lower tax rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the condition (or assumption) that ensures that the labor supply upward sloping?\nExplain the Laffer Curve",

    "text": "9.4 Business Cycles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nReal Business Cycle Theory (RBC)\n\n\n\nAccording to the Real Business Cycle Theory (RBC), the economy is constantly adjusting to technology shocks (e.g., an oil price shock) that keep hitting the economy. After a shock, the economy “swings” back to equilibrium. This interplay of shocks and the post-shock reaction of the economy causes fluctuations in GDP, employment, investment, etc.\n\n9.4.1 RBC and Adverse Shock\nAn adverse shock to the economy (like an oil price shock) shifts the labor demand curve to the left. Think of this as a negative shock to TFP, the letter A in the production function discussed above. As TFP decreases, labor becomes less productive, so that firms start demanding less of it. The result is lower wages, reduced employment, and reduced output. The economy contracts (shrinks).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: RBC and adverse shocks\n\n\n\nThe key lesson from real business cycle theory is that potential output itself will vary over time, depending on the level of TFP.\n\n\n9.4.2 Dividing Output Among Competing Demands\nTogether, labor and the supply of capital determine the level of output through the production function. This means that in a full-employment economy, total GDP is determined by the supply of factors of production.\nFull-employment GDP must be divided among competing demands in the economy. For example, increased government spending affects private spending (Crowding out).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCrowding Out\nIncreased government spending “crowds out” other demands for GDP.\n\n\nCrowding out illustrates the principle of opportunity cost.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPRINCIPLE of Opportunity Cost\nThe opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.\n\n\nAt full employment, the opportunity cost of increased government spending is some other component of GDP that needs to decrease in order to clear the accounting identity\n\\[Y = C + I + G + NX\\]\n\nCrowding Out:\n\nAt full employment, that is Y is fixed, G increases, then either C, I, or NX or a combination of these decrease\n\nCrowding In:\n\nG decreases, hence, C,I, or NX increase\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Crowding Out in a Closed Economy\nAn economy without international trade is called a closed economy. In this economy, full-employment output is divided among three different demands:\n\\[Y=C+I+G\\]\nThe supply of output (Y) is fixed. Therefore, increases in government spending reduce, or crowd out, either consumption or investment. In general, both are affected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: Increased Government Spending Crowds Out Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.10: Increased Government Spending also Crowds Out Investment\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Crowding Out in an Open Economy\nIn an open economy, an economy with international trade, full-employment output is divided among four uses:\n\\[Y=C+I+G+NX\\]\nIn an open economy, increases in government spending need not crowd out either consumption or investment. Increased government spending could lead to reduced exports and increased imports.\n\n\n9.4.5 Crowding In\nWhen governments cut spending and the level of output is fixed, some other type of spending will increase. We call this crowding in.\n\n\nIn a closed economy, consumption or investment or both could increase.\nIn an open economy, net exports could increase as well.\n\n\nThe nature of changes in government spending will have some effect on the type of spending that is crowded in (or crowded out)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nRBC theory studies the effects of technology shocks on the economy.\nCrowding out describes how an increase in government spending causes either private consumption, investment or net exports to decrease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain the concept of crowding-out.\nExplain the concept of crowding-in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Production function with labor input and capital held constant.\nFigure 9.2: Production function with labor input and capital held constant.\nFigure 9.3: Labor Market Equilibrium\nFigure 9.4: Wages and the Demand and Supply for Labor\nFigure 9.5: Full employment equilibrium and full employment output.\nFigure 9.6: Laffer Curve\nFigure 9.7: Tax on labor decreases labor demand.

    "text": "10.1 The Relatively Recent Arrival of Economic Growth\nLet’s begin with a brief overview of spectacular economic growth patterns around the world in the last two centuries. We commonly refer to this as the period of modern economic growth. (Later in the chapter we will discuss lower economic growth rates and some key ingredients for economic progress.) Rapid and sustained economic growth is a relatively recent experience for the human race. Before the last two centuries, although rulers, nobles, and conquerors could afford some extravagances and although economies rose above the subsistence level, the average person’s standard of living had not changed much for centuries.\nProgressive, powerful economic and institutional changes started to have a significant effect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. According to the Dutch economic historian Jan Luiten van Zanden, slavery-based societies, favorable demographics, global trading routes, and standardized trading institutions that spread with different empires set the stage for the Industrial Revolution to succeed. The Industrial Revolution refers to the widespread use of power-driven machinery and the economic and social changes that resulted in the first half of the 1800s. Ingenious machines—the steam engine, the power loom, and the steam locomotive—performed tasks that otherwise would have taken vast numbers of workers to do. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain, and soon spread to the United States, Germany, and other countries.\nThe jobs for ordinary people working with these machines were often dirty and dangerous by modern standards, but the alternative jobs of that time in peasant agriculture and small-village industry were often dirty and dangerous, too. The new jobs of the Industrial Revolution typically offered higher pay and a chance for social mobility. A self-reinforcing cycle began: New inventions and investments generated profits, the profits provided funds for more new investment and inventions, and the investments and inventions provided opportunities for further profits. Slowly, a group of national economies in Europe and North America emerged from centuries of sluggishness into a period of rapid modern growth. During the last two centuries, the average GDP growth rate per capita in the leading industrialized countries has been about 2% per year. What were times like before then? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.\nThe Industrial Revolution led to increasing inequality among nations. Some economies took off, whereas others, like many of those in Africa or Asia, remained close to a subsistence standard of living. General calculations show that the 17 countries of the world with the most-developed economies had, on average, 2.4 times the GDP per capita of the world’s poorest economies in 1870. By 1960, the most developed economies had 4.2 times the GDP per capita of the poorest economies.\nHowever, by the middle of the twentieth century, some countries had shown that catching up was possible. Japan’s economic growth took off in the 1960s and 1970s, with a growth rate of real GDP per capita averaging 11% per year during those decades. Certain countries in Latin America experienced a boom in economic growth in the 1960s as well. In Brazil, for example, GDP per capita expanded by an average annual rate of 11.1% from 1968 to 1973. In the 1970s, some East Asian economies, including South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan, saw rapid growth. In these countries, growth rates of 11% to 12% per year in GDP per capita were not uncommon. More recently, China, with its population of nearly 1.4 billion people, grew at a per capita rate 9% per year from 1984 into the 2000s. India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has shown promising signs of economic growth, with growth in GDP per capita of about 4% per year during the 1990s and climbing toward 7% to 8% per year in the 2000s.\nThese waves of catch-up economic growth have not reached all shores. In certain African countries like Niger, Tanzania, and Sudan, for example, GDP per capita at the start of the 2000s was still less than $300, not much higher than it was in the nineteenth century and for centuries before that. In the context of the overall situation of low-income people around the world, the good economic news from China (population: 1.4 billion) and India (population: 1.3 billion) is, nonetheless, astounding and heartening.\nEconomic growth in the last two centuries has made a striking change in the human condition. Richard Easterlin, an economist at the University of Southern California, wrote in 2000:\nBy many measures, a revolution in the human condition is sweeping the world. Most people today are better fed, clothed, and housed than their predecessors two centuries ago. They are healthier, live longer, and are better educated. Women’s lives are less centered on reproduction and political democracy has gained a foothold. Although Western Europe and its offshoots have been the leaders of this advance, most of the less developed nations have joined in during the 20th century, with the newly emerging nations of sub-Saharan Africa the latest to participate. Although the picture is not one of universal progress, it is the greatest advance in the human condition of the world’s population ever achieved in such a brief span of time.",

    "text": "Chapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the conditions that have allowed for modern economic growth in the last two centuries\nAnalyze the influence of public policies on an economy's long-run economic growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT WERE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS LIKE BEFORE 1870?\nAngus Maddison, a quantitative economic historian, led the most systematic inquiry into national incomes before 1870. Economists recently have refined and used his methods to compile GDP per capita estimates from year 1 C.E. (Note: C.E. stands for \"Common Era\" it's the religion free expression for A.D. which stands for \"Anno Domini\") to 1348. Table Table 10.1 is an important counterpoint to most of the narrative in this chapter. It shows that nations can decline as well as rise. A wide array of forces, such as epidemics, natural and weather-related disasters, the inability to govern large empires, and the remarkably slow pace of technological and institutional progress explain declines in income. Institutions are the traditions and laws by which people in a community agree to behave and govern themselves. Such institutions include marriage, religion, education, and laws of governance. Institutional progress is the development and codification of these institutions to reinforce social order, and thus, economic growth.\nOne example of such an institution is the Magna Carta (Great Charter), which the English nobles forced King John to sign in 1215. The Magna Carta codified the principles of due process, whereby a free man could not be penalized unless his peers had made a lawful judgment against him. The United States in its own constitution later adopted this concept. This social order may have contributed to England’s GDP per capita in 1348, which was second to that of northern Italy.\nIn studying economic growth, a country’s institutional framework plays a critical role. Table 10.1 also shows relative global equality for almost 1,300 years. After this, we begin to see significant divergence in income (not in the table).\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: GDP Per Capita Estimates in Current International Dollars from AD 1 to 1348 (Source: Bolt and van Zanden.

At its height, the empire spanned large regions of the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain until its gradual decline over 200 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1 Rule of Law and Economic Growth\nEconomic growth depends on many factors. Key among those factors is adherence to the rule of law and protection of property rights and contractual rights by a country’s government so that markets can work effectively and efficiently. Laws must be clear, public, fair, enforced, and equally applicable to all members of society. Property rights, as you might recall from Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities are the rights of individuals and firms to own property and use it as they see fit. If you have $100, you have the right to use that money, whether you spend it, lend it, or keep it in a jar. It is your property. The definition of property includes physical property as well as the right to your training and experience, especially since your training is what determines your livelihood. Using this property includes the right to enter into contracts with other parties with your property. Individuals or firms must own the property to enter into a contract.\nContractual rights, then, are based on property rights and they allow individuals to enter into agreements with others regarding the use of their property providing recourse through the legal system in the event of noncompliance. One example is the employment agreement: a skilled surgeon operates on an ill person and expects payment. Failure to pay would constitute property theft by the patient. The theft is property the services that the surgeon provided. In a society with strong property rights and contractual rights, the terms of the patient–surgeon contract will be fulfilled, because the surgeon would have recourse through the court system to extract payment from that individual. Without a legal system that enforces contracts, people would not be likely to enter into contracts for current or future services because of the risk of non-payment. This would make it difficult to transact business and would slow economic growth.\nThe World Bank considers a country’s legal system effective if it upholds property rights and contractual rights. The World Bank has developed a ranking system for countries’ legal systems based on effective protection of property rights and rule-based governance using a scale from 1 to 6, with 1 being the lowest and 6 the highest rating. In 2013, the world average ranking was 2.9. The three countries with the lowest ranking of 1.5 were Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, and Zimbabwe. Their GDP per capita was $679, $333, and $1,007 respectively. The World Bank cites Afghanistan as having a low standard of living, weak government structure, and lack of adherence to the rule of law, which has stymied its economic growth. The landlocked Central African Republic has poor economic resources as well as political instability and is a source of children used in human trafficking. Zimbabwe has had declining and often negative growth for much of the period since 1998. Land redistribution and price controls have disrupted the economy, and corruption and violence have dominated the political process. Although global economic growth has increased, those countries lacking a clear system of property rights and an independent court system free from corruption have lagged far behind.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nSince the early nineteenth century, there has been a spectacular process of long-run economic growth during which the world’s leading economies—mostly those in Western Europe and North America—expanded GDP per capita at an average rate of about 2% per year.\nIn the last half-century, countries like Japan, South Korea, and China have shown the potential to catch up. The Industrial Revolution facilitated the extensive process of economic growth, that economists often refer to as modern economic growth.\nThis increased worker productivity and trade, as well as the development of governance and market institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplain what the Industrial Revolution was and where it began.\nExplain the difference between property rights and contractual rights. Why do they matter to economic growth?\nHow did the Industrial Revolution increase the economic growth rate and income levels in the United States?\nHow much should a nation be concerned if its rate of economic growth is just 2% slower than other nations?\nOver the past 50 years, many countries have experienced an annual growth rate in real GDP per capita greater than that of the United States. Some examples are China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Does that mean the United States is regressing relative to other countries? Does that mean these countries will eventually overtake the United States in terms of the growth rate of real GDP per capita? Explain.",

    "text": "10.2 Labor Productivity and Economic Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the role of labor productivity in promoting economic growth\nAnalyze the sources of economic growth using the aggregate production function\nMeasure an economy’s rate of productivity growth\nEvaluate the power of sustained growth\n\n\n\nSustained long-term economic growth comes from increases in worker productivity, which essentially means how well we do things. In other words, how efficient is your nation with its time and workers? Labor productivity is the value that each employed person creates per unit of his or her input. The easiest way to comprehend labor productivity is to imagine a Canadian worker who can make 10 loaves of bread in an hour versus a U.S. worker who in the same hour can make only two loaves of bread. In this fictional example, the Canadians are more productive. More productivity essentially means you can do more in the same amount of time. This in turn frees up resources for workers to use elsewhere.\nWhat determines how productive workers are? The answer is pretty intuitive. The first determinant of labor productivity is human capital. Human capital is the accumulated knowledge (from education and experience), skills, and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses. Typically the higher the average level of education in an economy, the higher the accumulated human capital and the higher the labor productivity.\nThe second factor that determines labor productivity is technological change. Technological change is a combination of invention—advances in knowledge—and innovation, which is putting those advances to use in a new product or service. For example, the transistor was invented in 1947. It allowed us to miniaturize the footprint of electronic devices and use less power than the tube technology that came before it. Innovations since then have produced smaller and better transistors that are ubiquitous in products as varied as smart-phones, computers, and escalators. Developing the transistor has allowed workers to be anywhere with smaller devices. People can use these devices to communicate with other workers, measure product quality or do any other task in less time, improving worker productivity.\nThe third factor that determines labor productivity is economies of scale. Recall that economies of scale are the cost advantages that industries obtain due to size. (Read more about economies of scale in Production, Cost and Industry Structure.) Consider again the case of the fictional Canadian worker who could produce 10 loaves of bread in an hour. If this difference in productivity was due only to economies of scale, it could be that the Canadian worker had access to a large industrial-size oven while the U.S. worker was using a standard residential size oven.\nNow that we have explored the determinants of worker productivity, let’s turn to how economists measure economic growth and productivity.\n\n10.2.1 Sources of Economic Growth: The Aggregate Production Function\nTo analyze the sources of economic growth, it is useful to think about a production function, which is the technical relationship by which economic inputs like labor, machinery, and raw materials like goods and services that consumers use.\nA microeconomic production function describes a firm's or perhaps an industry's inputs and outputs. In macroeconomics, we call the connection from inputs to outputs for the entire economy an aggregate production function.\n\n\n10.2.2 Components of the Aggregate Production Function\nEconomists construct different production functions depending on the focus of their studies. Figure 10.4 presents two examples of aggregate production functions. In the first production function in Figure 10.4 (a), the output is GDP. The inputs in this example are workforce, human capital, physical capital, and technology. We discuss these inputs further in the module, Components of Economic Growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: An aggregate production function shows what goes into producing the output for an overall economy. (a) This aggregate production function has GDP as its output. (b) This aggregate production function has GDP per capita as its output. Because we calculate it on a per-person basis, we already figure the labor input into the other factors and we do not need to list it separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.3 Measuring Productivity\nAn economy’s rate of productivity growth is closely linked to the growth rate of its GDP per capita, although the two are not identical. For example, if the percentage of the population who holds jobs in an economy increases, GDP per capita will increase but the productivity of individual workers may not be affected. Over the long term, the only way that GDP per capita can grow continually is if the productivity of the average worker rises or if there are complementary increases in capital.\nA common measure of U.S. productivity per worker is dollar value per hour the worker contributes to the employer’s output. This measure excludes government workers, because their output is not sold in the market and so their productivity is hard to measure. It also excludes farming, which accounts for only a relatively small share of the U.S. economy. Figure 10.5 shows an index of output per hour, with 2009 as the base year (when the index equals 100). The index equaled about 106 in 2014. In 1972, the index equaled 50, which shows that workers have more than doubled their productivity since then.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.5: Output per hour worked is a measure of worker productivity. In the U.S. economy, worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the mid-1990s compared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per year. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the line. The average U.S. worker produced over twice as much per hour in 2014 than he did in the early 1970s. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\n\n\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor, U.S. productivity growth was fairly strong in the 1950s but then declined in the 1970s and 1980s before rising again in the second half of the 1990s and the first half of the 2000s. In fact, the rate of productivity measured by the change in output per hour worked averaged 3.2% per year from 1950 to 1970; dropped to 1.9% per year from 1970 to 1990; and then climbed back to over 2.3% from 1991 to the present, with another modest slowdown after 2001. Figure 10.6 shows average annual rates of productivity growth averaged over time since 1950.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.6: U.S. growth in worker productivity was very high between 1950 and 1970. It then declined to lower levels in the 1970s and the 1980s. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw productivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a bit in the 2000s. Some think the productivity rebound of the late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a “new economy” built on higher productivity growth, but we cannot determine this until more time has passed. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.4 The “New Economy” Controversy\nIn recent years a controversy has been brewing among economists about the resurgence of U.S. productivity in the second half of the 1990s. One school of thought argues that the United States had developed a “new economy” based on the extraordinary advances in communications and information technology of the 1990s. The most optimistic proponents argue that it would generate higher average productivity growth for decades to come. The pessimists, alternatively, argue that even five or ten years of stronger productivity growth does not prove that higher productivity will last for the long term. It is hard to infer anything about long-term productivity trends during the later part of the 2000s, because the steep 2008-2009 recession, with its sharp but not completely synchronized declines in output and employment, complicates any interpretation. While productivity growth was high in 2009 and 2010 (around 3%), it has slowed down since then.\nProductivity growth is also closely linked to the average level of wages. Over time, the amount that firms are willing to pay workers will depend on the value of the output those workers produce. If a few employers tried to pay their workers less than what those workers produced, then those workers would receive offers of higher wages from other profit-seeking employers. If a few employers mistakenly paid their workers more than what those workers produced, those employers would soon end up with losses. In the long run, productivity per hour is the most important determinant of the average wage level in any economy. To learn how to compare economies in this regard, follow the steps in the following Work It Out feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCOMPARING THE ECONOMIES OF TWO COUNTRIES\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tracks data on the annual growth rate of real GDP per hour worked. You can find these data on the OECD data webpage “Growth in GDP per capita, productivity and ULC” at this website.\n\nStep 1.\n\nVisit the OECD website given above and select two countries to compare.\n\nStep 2.\n\nOn the drop-down menu “Subject,” select ” GDP per capita, constant prices,” and under “Measure,” select “Annual growth/change.” Then record the data for the countries you have chosen for the five most recent years.\n\nStep 3.\n\nGo back to the drop-down “Subject” menu and select “GDP per hour worked, constant prices,” and under “Measure” again select “Annual growth/change.” Select data for the same years for which you selected GDP per capita data.\n\nStep 4.\n\nCompare real GDP growth for both countries. The following tables provide an example of a comparison between Belgium and Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n\n\n\n\nReal GDP/Capita Growth (%)\n2.3%\n1.5%\n1.3%\n1.4\n0.1%\n\n\nReal GDP Growth/Hours Worked (%)\n1.7%\n−0.1%\n1.4%\n2.2%\n−0.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelgium\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n\n\n\n\nReal GDP/Capita Growth (%)\n0.9\n−0.6\n−0.5\n1.2\n1.0\n\n\nReal GDP Growth/Hours Worked (%)\n−0.5\n−0.3\n0.4\n1.4\n0.9\n\n\n\n\nStep 5.\n\nFor both measures, growth in Canada is greater than growth in Belgium for the first four years. In addition, there are year-to-year fluctuations. Many factors can affect growth. For example, one factor that may have contributed to Canada’s stronger growth may be its larger inflows of immigrants, who generally contribute to economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2.5 The Power of Sustained Economic Growth\nNothing is more important for people’s standard of living than sustained economic growth. Even small changes in the rate of growth, when sustained and compounded over long periods of time, make an enormous difference in the standard of living. Consider Table, in which the rows of the table show several different rates of growth in GDP per capita and the columns show different periods of time. Assume for simplicity that an economy starts with a GDP per capita of 100. The table then applies the following formula to calculate what GDP will be at the given growth rate in the future:\n\\[\\text{GDP at starting date} \\times (1 + \\text{growth rate of GDP})^{\\text{years}} = \\text{GDP at end date}\\]\nFor example, an economy that starts with a GDP of 100 and grows at 3% per year will reach a GDP of 209 after 25 years; that is,\n\\[100 \\times (1.03)^25 = 209.\\]\nThe slowest rate of GDP per capita growth in the table, just 1% per year, is similar to what the United States experienced during its weakest years of productivity growth. The second highest rate, 3% per year, is close to what the U.S. economy experienced during the strong economy of the late 1990s and into the 2000s. Higher rates of per capita growth, such as 5% or 8% per year, represent the experience of rapid growth in economies like Japan, Korea, and China.\nTable 10.2 shows that even a few percentage points of difference in economic growth rates will have a profound effect if sustained and compounded over time. For example, an economy growing at a 1% annual rate over 50 years will see its GDP per capita rise by a total of 64%, from 100 to 164 in this example.\nHowever, a country growing at a 5% annual rate will see (almost) the same amount of growth—from 100 to 163—over just 10 years. Rapid rates of economic growth can bring profound transformation. (See the following Clear It Up feature on the relationship between compound growth rates and compound interest rates.) If the rate of growth is 8%, young adults starting at age 20 will see the average standard of living in their country more than double by the time they reach age 30, and grow nearly sixfold by the time they reach age 45.\n\n\n\nTable 10.2: Growth of GDP over Different Time Horizons\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowth Rate\nValue of 100 in 10 Years\nValue of 100 in 25 Years\nValue of 100 in 50 Years\n\n\n\n\n1%\n110\n128\n164\n\n\n3%\n134\n209\n438\n\n\n5%\n163\n339\n1,147\n\n\n8%\n216\n685\n4,690\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW ARE COMPOUND GROWTH RATES AND COMPOUND INTEREST RATES RELATED?\nThe formula for GDP growth rates over different periods of time, as Figure shows, is exactly the same as the formula for how a given amount of financial savings grows at a certain interest rate over time, as presented in Choice in a World of Scarcity. Both formulas have the same ingredients:\n\nan original starting amount, in one case GDP and in the other case an amount of financial saving;\na percentage increase over time, in one case the GDP growth rate and in the other case an interest rate;\nand an amount of time over which this effect happens.\n\nRecall that compound interest is interest that is earned on past interest. It causes the total amount of financial savings to grow dramatically over time. Similarly, compound rates of economic growth, or the compound growth rate, means that we multiply the rate of growth by a base that includes past GDP growth, with dramatic effects over time.\nFor example, in 2013, the Central Intelligence Agency's World Fact Book reported that South Korea had a GDP of $1.67 trillion with a growth rate of 2.8%. We can estimate that at that growth rate, South Korea’s GDP will be $1.92 trillion in five years. If we apply the growth rate to each year’s ending GDP for the next five years, we will calculate that at the end of year one, GDP is $1.72 trillion. In year two, we start with the end-of-year one value of $1.72 and increase it by 2.8%. Year three starts with the end-of-year two GDP, and we increase it by 2.8% and so on, as Table 10.2 depicts.\n\n\n\nTable 10.3: Growth Rates\n\n\n\n\n\nYear\nStarting GDP\nGrowth Rate 2%\nYear-End Amount\n\n\n\n\n1\n$1.67 Trillion ×\n(1+0.028)\n$1.72 Trillion\n\n\n2\n$1.72 Trillion ×\n(1+0.028)\n$1.76 Trillion\n\n\n3\n$1.76 Trillion ×\n(1+0.028)\n$1.81 Trillion\n\n\n4\n$1.81 Trillion ×\n(1+0.028)\n$1.87 Trillion\n\n\n5\n$1.87 Trillion ×\n(1+0.028)\n$1.92 Trillion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to calculate the growth rate is to apply the following formula:\n\\[\\text{Future Value} = \\text{Present Value} \\times (1 + g)^n\\]\nWhere “future value” is the value of GDP five years hence, “present value” is the starting GDP amount of $1.67 trillion, “g” is the growth rate of 2.8%, and “n” is the number of periods for which we are calculating growth.\n\\[\\text{Future Value} = 1.67 × (1+0.028)^5 = \\$1.92 \\text{trillion}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nWe can measure productivity, the value of what is produced per worker, or per hour worked, as the level of GDP per worker or GDP per hour. The United States experienced a productivity slowdown between 1973 and 1989. Since then, U.S. productivity has rebounded for the most part, but annual growth in productivity in the nonfarm business sector has been less than one percent each year between 2011 and 2016. It is not clear what productivity growth will be in the coming years. The rate of productivity growth is the primary determinant of an economy’s rate of long-term economic growth and higher wages. Over decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita. An aggregate production function specifies how certain inputs in the economy, like human capital, physical capital, and technology, lead to the output measured as GDP per capita.\nCompound interest and compound growth rates behave in the same way as productivity rates. Seemingly small changes in percentage points can have big impacts on income over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there other ways in which we can measure productivity besides the amount produced per hour of work?\nAssume there are two countries: South Korea and the United States. South Korea grows at 4% and the United States grows at 1%. For the sake of simplicity, assume they both start from the same fictional income level, $10,000. What will the incomes of the United States and South Korea be in 20 years? By how many multiples will each country’s income grow in 20 years?\nHow is GDP per capita calculated differently from labor productivity?\nHow do gains in labor productivity lead to gains in GDP per capita?\nLabor Productivity and Economic Growth outlined the logic of how increased productivity is associated with increased wages. Detail a situation where this is not the case and explain why it is not.\nChange in labor productivity is one of the most watched international statistics of growth. Visit the St. Louis Federal Reserve website and find the data section (http://research.stlouisfed.org). Find international comparisons of labor productivity, listed under the FRED Economic database (Growth Rate of Total Labor Productivity), and compare two countries in the recent past. State what you think the reasons for differences in labor productivity could be.\nRefer back to the Work It Out about Comparing the Economies of Two Countries and examine the data for the two countries you chose.

In this module, we discuss some of the components of economic growth, including physical capital, human capital, and technology.\nThe category of physical capital includes the plant and equipment that firms use as well as things like roads (also called infrastructure). Again, greater physical capital implies more output. Physical capital can affect productivity in two ways: (1) an increase in the quantity of physical capital (for example, more computers of the same quality); and (2) an increase in the quality of physical capital (same number of computers but the computers are faster, and so on). Human capital refers to the skills and knowledge that make workers productive. Human capital and physical capital accumulation are similar: In both cases, investment now pays off in higher productivity in the future.\nThe category of technology is the “joker in the deck.” Earlier we described it as the combination of invention and innovation. When most people think of new technology, the invention of new products like the laser, the smartphone, or some new wonder drug come to mind. In food production, developing more drought-resistant seeds is another example of technology. Technology, as economists use the term, however, includes still more. It includes new ways of organizing work, like the invention of the assembly line, new methods for ensuring better quality of output in factories, and innovative institutions that facilitate the process of converting inputs into output. In short, technology comprises all the advances that make the existing machines and other inputs produce more, and at higher quality, as well as altogether new products.\nIt may not make sense to compare the GDPs of China and say, Benin, simply because of the great difference in population size. To understand economic growth, which is really concerned with the growth in living standards of an average person, it is often useful to focus on GDP per capita. Using GDP per capita also makes it easier to compare countries with smaller numbers of people, like Belgium, Uruguay, or Zimbabwe, with countries that have larger populations, like the United States, the Russian Federation, or Nigeria.\nTo obtain a per capita production function, divide each input in [link](a) by the population. This creates a second aggregate production function where the output is GDP per capita (that is, GDP divided by population). The inputs are the average level of human capital per person, the average level of physical capital per person, and the level of technology per person—see [link](b). The result of having population in the denominator is mathematically appealing. Increases in population lower per capita income. However, increasing population is important for the average person only if the rate of income growth exceeds population growth. A more important reason for constructing a per capita production function is to understand the contribution of human and physical capital.\n\n10.3.1 Capital Deepening\nWhen society increases the level of capital per person, we call the result capital deepening. The idea of capital deepening can apply both to additional human capital per worker and to additional physical capital per worker.\nRecall that one way to measure human capital is to look at the average levels of education in an economy. Figure 10.7 illustrates the human capital deepening for U.S. workers by showing that the proportion of the U.S. population with a high school and a college degree is rising. As recently as 1970, for example, only about half of U.S. adults had at least a high school diploma. By the start of the twenty-first century, more than 80% of adults had graduated from high school.\nThe idea of human capital deepening also applies to the years of experience that workers have, but the average experience level of U.S. workers has not changed much in recent decades. Thus, the key dimension for deepening human capital in the U.S. economy focuses more on additional education and training than on a higher average level of work experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.7: Rising levels of education for persons 25 and older show the deepening of human capital in the U.S. economy. Even today, under one-third of U.S. adults have completed a four-year college degree. There is clearly room for additional deepening of human capital to occur. (Source: US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics)\n\n\n\nFigure 10.8 shows physical capital deepening in the U.S. economy. The average U.S. worker in the late 2000s was working with physical capital worth almost three times as much as that of the average worker of the early 1950s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.8: The value of the physical capital, measured by plant and equipment, used by the average worker in the U.S. economy has risen over the decades. The increase may have leveled off a bit in the 1970s and 1980s, which were, not coincidentally, times of slower-than-usual growth in worker productivity. We see a renewed increase in physical capital per worker in the late 1990s, followed by a flattening in the early 2000s. (Source: Center for International Comparisons of Production, Income and Prices, University of Pennsylvania)\n\n\n\nNot only does the current U.S. economy have better-educated workers with more and improved physical capital than it did several decades ago, but these workers have access to more advanced technologies. Growth in technology is impossible to measure with a simple line on a graph, but evidence that we live in an age of technological marvels is all around us—discoveries in genetics and in the structure of particles, the wireless internet, and other inventions almost too numerous to count. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office typically has issued more than 150,000 patents annually in recent years.\nThis recipe for economic growth—investing in labor productivity, with investments in human capital and technology, as well as increasing physical capital—also applies to other economies. South Korea, for example, already achieved universal enrollment in primary school (the equivalent of kindergarten through sixth grade in the United States) by 1965, when Korea’s GDP per capita was still near its rock bottom low. By the late 1980s, Korea had achieved almost universal secondary school education (the equivalent of a high school education in the United States). With regard to physical capital, Korea’s rates of investment had been about 15% of GDP at the start of the 1960s, but doubled to 30–35% of GDP by the late 1960s and early 1970s. With regard to technology, South Korean students went to universities and colleges around the world to obtain scientific and technical training, and South Korean firms reached out to study and form partnerships with firms that could offer them technological insights. These factors combined to foster South Korea’s high rate of economic growth.\n\n\n10.3.2 Growth Accounting Studies\nSince the late 1950s, economists have conducted growth accounting studies to determine the extent to which physical and human capital deepening and technology have contributed to growth. The usual approach uses an aggregate production function to estimate how much of per capita economic growth can be attributed to growth in physical capital and human capital. We can measure these two inputs at least roughly. The part of growth that is unexplained by measured inputs, called the residual, is then attributed to growth in technology. The exact numerical estimates differ from study to study and from country to country, depending on how researchers measured these three main factors and over what time horizons. For studies of the U.S. economy, three lessons commonly emerge from growth accounting studies.\nFirst, technology is typically the most important contributor to U.S. economic growth. Growth in human capital and physical capital often explains only half or less than half of the economic growth that occurs. New ways of doing things are tremendously important.\nSecond, while investment in physical capital is essential to growth in labor productivity and GDP per capita, building human capital is at least as important. Economic growth is not just a matter of more machines and buildings. One vivid example of the power of human capital and technological knowledge occurred in Europe in the years after World War II (1939–1945). During the war, a large share of Europe’s physical capital, such as factories, roads, and vehicles, was destroyed. Europe also lost an overwhelming amount of human capital in the form of millions of men, women, and children who died during the war. However, the powerful combination of skilled workers and technological knowledge, working within a market-oriented economic framework, rebuilt Europe’s productive capacity to an even higher level within less than two decades.\nA third lesson is that these three factors of human capital, physical capital, and technology work together. Workers with a higher level of education and skills are often better at coming up with new technological innovations. These technological innovations are often ideas that cannot increase production until they become a part of new investment in physical capital. New machines that embody technological innovations often require additional training, which builds worker skills further. If the recipe for economic growth is to succeed, an economy needs all the ingredients of the aggregate production function. See the following Clear It Up feature for an example of how human capital, physical capital, and technology can combine to significantly impact lives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW DO GIRLS’ EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC GROWTH RELATE IN LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES?\nIn the early 2000s, according to the World Bank, about 110 million children between the ages of 6 and 11 were not in school—and about two-thirds of them were girls. In Afghanistan, for example, the literacy rate for those aged 15-24 for the period 2005-2014 was 62% for males and only 32% for females. In Benin, in West Africa, it was 55% for males and 31% for females. In Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, it was 76% for males and 58 percent for females.\nWhenever any child does not receive a basic education, it is both a human and an economic loss. In low-income countries, wages typically increase by an average of 10 to 20% with each additional year of education. There is, however, some intriguing evidence that helping girls in low-income countries to close the education gap with boys may be especially important, because of the social role that many of the girls will play as mothers and homemakers.\nGirls in low-income countries who receive more education tend to grow up to have fewer, healthier, better-educated children. Their children are more likely to be better nourished and to receive basic health care like immunizations. Economic research on women in low-income economies backs up these findings. When 20 women obtain one additional year of schooling, as a group they will, on average, have one less child. When 1,000 women obtain one additional year of schooling, on average one to two fewer women from that group will die in childbirth. When a woman stays in school an additional year, that factor alone means that, on average, each of her children will spend an additional half-year in school. Education for girls is a good investment because it is an investment in economic growth with benefits beyond the current generation.\n\n\n\n\n10.3.3 A Healthy Climate for Economic Growth\nWhile physical and human capital deepening and better technology are important, equally important to a nation’s well-being is the climate or system within which these inputs are cultivated. Both the type of market economy and a legal system that governs and sustains property rights and contractual rights are important contributors to a healthy economic climate.\nA healthy economic climate usually involves some sort of market orientation at the microeconomic, individual, or firm decision-making level. Markets that allow personal and business rewards and incentives for increasing human and physical capital encourage overall macroeconomic growth. For example, when workers participate in a competitive and well-functioning labor market, they have an incentive to acquire additional human capital, because additional education and skills will pay off in higher wages. Firms have an incentive to invest in physical capital and in training workers, because they expect to earn higher profits for their shareholders. Both individuals and firms look for new technologies, because even small inventions can make work easier or lead to product improvement. Collectively, such individual and business decisions made within a market structure add up to macroeconomic growth. Much of the rapid growth since the late nineteenth century has come from harnessing the power of competitive markets to allocate resources. This market orientation typically reaches beyond national borders and includes openness to international trade.\nA general orientation toward markets does not rule out important roles for government. There are times when markets fail to allocate capital or technology in a manner that provides the greatest benefit for society as a whole. The government's role is to correct these failures. In addition, government can guide or influence markets toward certain outcomes. The following examples highlight some important areas that governments around the world have chosen to invest in to facilitate capital deepening and technology:\n\n\nEducation.\n\nThe Danish government requires all children under 16 to attend school. They can choose to attend a public school (Folkeskole) or a private school. Students do not pay tuition to attend Folkeskole. Thirteen percent of primary/secondary (elementary/high) school is private, and the government supplies vouchers to citizens who choose private school.\n\nSavings and Investment.\n\nIn the United States, as in other countries, the government taxes gains from private investment. Low capital gains taxes encourage investment and so also economic growth.\n\nInfrastructure.\n\nThe Japanese government in the mid-1990s undertook significant infrastructure projects to improve roads and public works. This in turn increased the stock of physical capital and ultimately economic growth.\n\nSpecial Economic Zones.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is one of the few African nations to encourage international trade in government-supported special economic zones (SEZ). These are areas of the country, usually with access to a port where, among other benefits, the government does not tax trade. As a result of its SEZ, Mauritius has enjoyed above-average economic growth since the 1980s. Free trade does not have to occur in an SEZ however. Governments can encourage international trade across the board, or surrender to protectionism.\n\nScientific Research.\n\nThe European Union has strong programs to invest in scientific research. The researchers Abraham García and Pierre Mohnen demonstrate that firms which received support from the Austrian government actually increased their research intensity and had more sales. Governments can support scientific research and technical training that helps to create and spread new technologies. Governments can also provide a legal environment that protects the ability of inventors to profit from their inventions.\n\n\n\nThere are many more ways in which the government can play an active role in promoting economic growth. We explore them in other chapters and in particular in Macroeconomic Policy Around the World. A healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita and labor productivity includes human capital deepening, physical capital deepening, and technological gains, operating in a market-oriented economy with supportive government policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nOver decades and generations, seemingly small differences of a few percentage points in the annual rate of economic growth make an enormous difference in GDP per capita.\nCapital deepening refers to an increase in the amount of capital per worker, either human capital per worker, in the form of higher education or skills, or physical capital per worker.\nTechnology, in its economic meaning, refers broadly to all new methods of production, which includes major scientific inventions but also small inventions and even better forms of management or other types of institutions.\nA healthy climate for growth in GDP per capita consists of improvements in human capital, physical capital, and technology, in a market-oriented environment with supportive public policies and institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do the growth accounting studies conclude are the determinants of growth?

GDP increased by an average rate of 2.7% per year in the 1990s and 2.3% per year from 2000 to 2008 in the high-income countries of the world, which include the United States, Canada, the European Union countries, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand.\nThe following tables lists 10 countries that belong to an informal “fast growth club.” These countries averaged GDP growth (after adjusting for inflation) of at least 5% per year in both the time periods from 1990 to 2000 and from 2000 to 2008. Since economic growth in these countries has exceeded the average of the world’s high-income economies, these countries may converge with the high-income countries. Table 10.4 lists the “slow growth club,” which consists of countries that averaged GDP growth of 2% per year or less (after adjusting for inflation) during the same time periods. Table 10.5 shows GDP growth rates for the countries of the world divided by income.\nEconomic Growth around the World(Source: http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/variableSelection/selectvariables.aspx?source=world-development-indicators#c_u)\n\n\n\nTable 10.4: Fast Growth Club (&gt;= 5% per year in both time periods)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nAverage Growth Rate of Real GDP 1990–2000\nAverage Growth Rate of Real GDP 2000–2008\n\n\n\n\nCambodia\n7.1%\n\n9.1%\n\n\n\nChina\n10.6%\n\n9.9%\n\n\n\nIndia\n6.0%\n\n7.1%\n\n\n\nIreland\n7.5%\n\n5.1%\n\n\n\nJordan\n5.0%\n\n6.3%\n\n\n\nLaos\n6.5%\n\n6.8 %\n\n\n\nMozambique\n6.4%\n\n7.3%\n\n\n\nSudan\n5.4%\n\n7.3%\n\n\n\nUganda\n7.1%\n\n7.3%\n\n\n\nVietnam\n7.9%\n\n7.3%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.5: Slow Growth Club (&lt;= 2% per year in both time periods)\n\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nAverage Growth Rate of Real GDP 1990–2000\nAverage Growth Rate of Real GDP 2000–2008\n\n\n\n\nCentral African Republic\n2.0%\n0.8%\n\n\nFrance\n2.0%\n1.8%\n\n\nGermany\n1.8%\n1.3%\n\n\nGuinea-Bissau\n1.2%\n0.2%\n\n\nHaiti\n–1.5%\n0.3%\n\n\nItaly\n1.6%\n1.2%\n\n\nJamaica\n0.9%\n1.4%\n\n\nJapan\n1.3%\n1.3%\n\n\nSwitzerland\n1.0%\n2.0%\n\n\nUnited States (for reference)\n3.2%\n2.2%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorld Overview\n\n\nCountry Type\nAverage Growth Rate of Real GDP 1990–2000\nAverage Growth Rate of Real GDP 2000–2008\n\n\n\n\nHigh income\n2.7%\n2.3%\n\n\nLow income\n3.8%\n5.6%\n\n\nMiddle income\n4.7%\n6.1%\n\n\n\nEach of the countries in the previous tables has its own unique story of investments in human and physical capital, technological gains, market forces, government policies, and even lucky events, but an overall pattern of convergence is clear. The low-income countries have GDP growth that is faster than that of the middle-income countries, which in turn have GDP growth that is faster than that of the high-income countries. Two prominent members of the fast-growth club are China and India, which between them have nearly 40% of the world’s population. Some prominent members of the slow-growth club are high-income countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.\nWill this pattern of economic convergence persist into the future? This is a controversial question among economists that we will consider by looking at some of the main arguments on both sides.\n\n10.4.1 Arguments Favoring Convergence\nSeveral arguments suggest that low-income countries might have an advantage in achieving greater worker productivity and economic growth in the future.\nA first argument is based on diminishing marginal returns. Even though deepening human and physical capital will tend to increase GDP per capita, the law of diminishing returns suggests that as an economy continues to increase its human and physical capital, the marginal gains to economic growth will diminish. For example, raising the average education level of the population by two years from a tenth-grade level to a high school diploma (while holding all other inputs constant) would produce a certain increase in output. An additional two-year increase, so that the average person had a two-year college degree, would increase output further, but the marginal gain would be smaller. Yet another additional two-year increase in the level of education, so that the average person would have a four-year-college bachelor’s degree, would increase output still further, but the marginal increase would again be smaller. A similar lesson holds for physical capital. If the quantity of physical capital available to the average worker increases, by, say, $5,000 to $10,000 (again, while holding all other inputs constant), it will increase the level of output. An additional increase from $10,000 to $15,000 will increase output further, but the marginal increase will be smaller.\nLow-income countries like China and India tend to have lower levels of human capital and physical capital, so an investment in capital deepening should have a larger marginal effect in these countries than in high-income countries, where levels of human and physical capital are already relatively high. Diminishing returns implies that low-income economies could converge to the levels that the high-income countries achieve.\nA second argument is that low-income countries may find it easier to improve their technologies than high-income countries. High-income countries must continually invent new technologies, whereas low-income countries can often find ways of applying technology that has already been invented and is well understood. The economist Alexander Gerschenkron (1904–1978) gave this phenomenon a memorable name: “the advantages of backwardness.” Of course, he did not literally mean that it is an advantage to have a lower standard of living. He was pointing out that a country that is behind has some extra potential for catching up.\nFinally, optimists argue that many countries have observed the experience of those that have grown more quickly and have learned from it. Moreover, once the people of a country begin to enjoy the benefits of a higher standard of living, they may be more likely to build and support the market-friendly institutions that will help provide this standard of living.\n\n\n10.4.2 Arguments That Convergence Is neither Inevitable nor Likely\nIf the economy's growth depended only on the deepening of human capital and physical capital, then we would expect that economy's growth rate to slow down over the long run because of diminishing marginal returns. However, there is another crucial factor in the aggregate production function: technology.\nDeveloping new technology can provide a way for an economy to sidestep the diminishing marginal returns of capital deepening. Figure 10.9 shows how. The figure's horizontal axis measures the amount of capital deepening, which on this figure is an overall measure that includes deepening of both physical and human capital.\nThe amount of human and physical capital per worker increases as you move from left to right, from C1 to C2 to C3. The diagram's vertical axis measures per capita output. Start by considering the lowest line in this diagram, labeled Technology 1. Along this aggregate production function, the level of technology is held constant, so the line shows only the relationship between capital deepening and output. As capital deepens from C1 to C2 to C3 and the economy moves from R to U to W, per capita output does increase—but the way in which the line starts out steeper on the left but then flattens as it moves to the right shows the diminishing marginal returns, as additional marginal amounts of capital deepening increase output by ever-smaller amounts. The shape of the aggregate production line (Technology 1) shows that the ability of capital deepening, by itself, to generate sustained economic growth is limited, since diminishing returns will eventually set in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.9: Imagine that the economy starts at point R, with the level of physical and human capital C1 and the output per capita at G1. If the economy relies only on capital deepening, while remaining at the technology level shown by the Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal returns as it moved from point R to point U to point W. However, now imagine that capital deepening is combined with improvements in technology. Then, as capital deepens from C1 to C2, technology improves from Technology 1 to Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as capital deepens from C2 to C3, technology increases from Technology 2 to Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements in technology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth must necessarily slow down.\n\n\n\nNow, bring improvements in technology into the picture. Improved technology means that with a given set of inputs, more output is possible. The production function labeled Technology 1 in the figure is based on one level of technology, but Technology 2 is based on an improved level of technology, so for every level of capital deepening on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis. In turn, production function Technology 3 represents a still higher level of technology, so that for every level of inputs on the horizontal axis, it produces a higher level of output on the vertical axis than either of the other two aggregate production functions.\nMost healthy, growing economies are deepening their human and physical capital and increasing technology at the same time. As a result, the economy can move from a choice like point R on the Technology 1 aggregate production line to a point like S on Technology 2 and a point like T on the still higher aggregate production line (Technology 3). With the combination of technology and capital deepening, the rise in GDP per capita in high-income countries does not need to fade away because of diminishing returns. The gains from technology can offset the diminishing returns involved with capital deepening.\nWill technological improvements themselves run into diminishing returns over time? That is, will it become continually harder and more costly to discover new technological improvements? Perhaps someday, but, at least over the last two centuries since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, improvements in technology have not run into diminishing marginal returns. Modern inventions, like the internet or discoveries in genetics or materials science, do not seem to provide smaller gains to output than earlier inventions like the steam engine or the railroad. One reason that technological ideas do not seem to run into diminishing returns is that we often can apply widely the ideas of new technology at a marginal cost that is very low or even zero. A specific worker or group of workers must use a specific additional machine, or an additional year of education. Many workers across the economy can use a new technology or invention at very low marginal cost.\nThe argument that it is easier for a low-income country to copy and adapt existing technology than it is for a high-income country to invent new technology is not necessarily true, either. When it comes to adapting and using new technology, a society’s performance is not necessarily guaranteed, but is the result of whether the country's economic, educational, and public policy institutions are supportive. In theory, perhaps, low-income countries have many opportunities to copy and adapt technology, but if they lack the appropriate supportive economic infrastructure and institutions, the theoretical possibility that backwardness might have certain advantages is of little practical relevance.\n\n\n10.4.3 The Slowness of Convergence\nAlthough economic convergence between the high-income countries and the rest of the world seems possible and even likely, it will proceed slowly. Consider, for example, a country that starts off with a GDP per capita of $40,000, which would roughly represent a typical high-income country today, and another country that starts out at $4,000, which is roughly the level in low-income but not impoverished countries like Indonesia, Guatemala, or Egypt. Say that the rich country chugs along at a 2% annual growth rate of GDP per capita, while the poorer country grows at the aggressive rate of 7% per year. After 30 years, GDP per capita in the rich country will be $72,455. We get this using\n\\[$40,000 \\times (1 + 0.02)^{30}\\]\nwhile in the poor country it will be $30,450. This we got by\n\\[$4,000 \\times (1 + 0.07)^{30}.\\]\nConvergence has occurred. The rich country used to be 10 times as wealthy as the poor one, and now it is only about 2.4 times as wealthy. Even after 30 consecutive years of very rapid growth, however, people in the low-income country are still likely to feel quite poor compared to people in the rich country. Moreover, as the poor country catches up, its opportunities for catch-up growth are reduced, and its growth rate may slow down somewhat.\nAs countries grow, their growth rates usually decrease due to diminishing returns.\nThe slowness of convergence illustrates again that small differences in annual rates of economic growth become huge differences over time. The high-income countries have been building up their advantage in standard of living over decades—more than a century in some cases. Even in an optimistic scenario, it will take decades for the low-income countries of the world to catch up significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCALORIES AND ECONOMIC GROWTH\nWe can tell the story of modern economic growth by looking at calorie consumption over time. The dramatic rise in incomes allowed the average person to eat better and consume more calories. How did these incomes increase? The neoclassical growth consensus uses the aggregate production function to suggest that the period of modern economic growth came about because of increases in inputs such as technology and physical and human capital. Also important was the way in which technological progress combined with physical and human capital deepening to create growth and convergence. The issue of distribution of income notwithstanding, it is clear that the average worker can afford more calories in 2017 than in 1875.\nAside from increases in income, there is another reason why the average person can afford more food. Modern agriculture has allowed many countries to produce more food than they need. Despite having more than enough food, however, many governments and multilateral agencies have not solved the food distribution problem. In fact, food shortages, famine, or general food insecurity are caused more often by the failure of government macroeconomic policy, according to the Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen. Sen has conducted extensive research into issues of inequality, poverty, and the role of government in improving standards of living. Macroeconomic policies that strive toward stable inflation, full employment, education of women, and preservation of property rights are more likely to eliminate starvation and provide for a more even distribution of food.\nBecause we have more food per capita, global food prices have decreased since 1875. The prices of some foods, however, have decreased more than the prices of others. For example, researchers from the University of Washington have shown that in the United States, calories from zucchini and lettuce are 100 times more expensive than calories from oil, butter, and sugar. Research from countries like India, China, and the United States suggests that as incomes rise, individuals want more calories from fats and protein and fewer from carbohydrates. This has very interesting implications for global food production, obesity, and environmental consequences. Affluent urban India has an obesity problem much like many parts of the United States. The forces of convergence are at work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nWhen countries with lower GDP levels per capita catch up to countries with higher GDP levels per capita, we call the process convergence.\nConvergence can occur even when both high- and low-income countries increase investment in physical and human capital with the objective of growing GDP.\nThis is because the impact of new investment in physical and human capital on a low-income country may result in huge gains as new skills or equipment combine with the labor force.\nIn higher-income countries, however, a level of investment equal to that of the low income country is not likely to have as big an impact, because the more developed country most likely already has high levels of capital investment.\nTherefore, the marginal gain from this additional investment tends to be successively less and less. Higher income countries are more likely to have diminishing returns to their investments and must continually invent new technologies.\nThis allows lower-income economies to have a chance for convergent growth. However, many high-income economies have developed economic and political institutions that provide a healthy economic climate for an ongoing stream of technological innovations.\nContinuous technological innovation can counterbalance diminishing returns to investments in human and physical capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse an example to explain why, after periods of rapid growth, a low-income country that has not caught up to a high-income country may feel poor.\nWould the following events usually lead to capital deepening? Why or why not?\nA weak economy in which businesses become reluctant to make long-term investments in physical capital.\nA rise in international trade.\nA trend in which many more adults participate in continuing education courses through their employers and at colleges and universities.\nWhat are the “advantages of backwardness” for economic growth?\nWould you expect capital deepening to result in diminished returns? Why or why not? Would you expect improvements in technology to result in diminished returns? Why or why not?\nWhy does productivity growth in high-income economies not slow down as it runs into diminishing returns from additional investments in physical capital and human capital? Does this show one area where the theory of diminishing returns fails to apply? Why or why not?\nFor a high-income economy like the United States, what aggregate production function elements are most important in bringing about growth in GDP per capita? What about a middle-income country such as Brazil? A low-income country such as Niger?\nList some arguments for and against the likelihood of convergence.\nWhat sorts of policies can governments implement to encourage convergence?\nAs technological change makes us more sedentary and food costs increase, obesity is likely. What factors do you think may limit obesity?",

    "text": "10.5 Growth Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain growth rates\nDiscuss the “formula for multiple growth rates”\n\n\n\nIf some variable x (for example, the number of gallons of gasoline sold in a week) changes from \\(x_1\\) to \\(x_2\\), then we can define the change in that variable as \\(\\Delta x = x_2 − x_1\\). But there are difficulties with this simple definition. The number that we calculate will change, depending on the units in which we measure x. If we measure in millions of gallons, x will be a much smaller number than if we measure in gallons. If we measured x in liters rather than gallons (as it is measured in most countries), it would be a bigger number. So the number we calculate depends on the units we choose. To avoid these problems, we look at percentage changes and express the change as a fraction of the individual value. In what follows, we use the notation \\(\\%\\Delta x\\) to mean the percentage change in x and define it as follows:\n\\[\\%\\Delta x = (x_2 − x_1)/x_1.\\]\nA percentage change equal to 0.1 means that gasoline consumption increased by 10 percent. Why? Because 10 percent means 10 “per hundred,” so 10 percent = 10/100 = 0.1.\nVery often in economics, we are interested in changes that take place over time. Thus we might want to compare gross domestic product (GDP) between 2012 and 2013. Suppose we know that GDP in the United States in 2012 was $14 trillion and that GDP in 2013 was $14.7 trillion. Using the letter Y to denote GDP measured in trillions, we write Y2012 = 14.0 and Y2013 = 14.7.\nIf we want to talk about GDP at different points in time without specifying a particular year, we use the notation Yt. We express the change in a variable over time in the form of a growth rate, which is just an example of a percentage change. Thus the growth rate of GDP in 2013 is calculated as follows:\n\\[%ΔY2013 = (Y2013 − Y2012)/Y2012 = (14.7 − 14)/14 = 0.05.\\]\nThe growth rate equals 5 percent. In general, we write %ΔYt+1 = (Yt+1 − Yt)/Yt. Occasionally, we use the gross growth rate, which simply equals 1 + the growth rate. So, for example, the gross growth rate of GDP equals Y2013/Y2012, or 1.05.\nThere are some useful rules that describe the behavior of percentage changes and growth rates.\nThe Product Rule. Suppose we have three variables, x, y, and z, and suppose \\[x = y \\times z.\\]\nThen \\[\\%\\Delta x = \\% \\Delta y + \\%\\Delta z.\\]\nIn other words, the growth rate of a product of two variables equals the sum of the growth rates of the individual variables.\nThe Quotient Rule. Now suppose we rearrange our original equation by dividing both sides by z to obtain \\[y=\\frac{x}{z}.\\]\nIf we take the product rule and subtract %Δz from both sides, we get the following: \\[\\%\\Delta y = \\%\\Delta x − \\%\\Delta z.\\]\nThe Power Rule. There is one more rule of growth rates that we make use of in some advanced topics, such as growth accounting. Suppose that \\[y = x ^ a.\\]\nThen\n\\[\\%\\Delta y = a \\times (\\% \\Delta x).\\]\nFor example, if \\(y = x^2\\), then the growth rate of y is twice the growth rate of x. If y=x, then the growth rate of y is half the growth rate of x (remembering that a square root is the same as a power of \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\nMore Formally\nGrowth rates compound over time: if the growth rate of a variable is constant, then the change in the variable increases over time. For example, suppose GDP in 2020 is 20.0, and it grows at 10 percent per year. Then in 2021, GDP is 22.0 (an increase of 2.0), but in 2022, GDP is 24.2 (an increase of 2.2). If this compounding takes place every instant, then we say that we have exponential growth. Formally, we write exponential growth using the number e = 2.71828.… If the value of Y at time 0 equals Y0 and if Y grows at the constant rate g (where g is an “annualized” or per year growth rate), then at time t (measured in years), \\[Y_t = e^{g \\times t}Y_0.\\]\nA version of this formula can also be used to calculate the average growth rate of a variable if we know its value at two different times. We can write the formula as \\[e^{g \\times t} = Y_t/Y_0,\\]\nwhich also means \\[g \\times t = ln(Yt/Y0), \\]\nwhere \\(\\ln()\\) is the natural logarithm. You do not need to know exactly what this means; you can simply calculate a logarithm using a scientific calculator or a spreadsheet. Dividing by t we get the average growth rate \\[g = ln(Y_t/Y_0)/t.\\]\nFor example, suppose GDP in 2020 is 20.0 and GDP in 2030 is 28.0. Then Y2030/Y2020 = 28/20 = 1.4. Using a calculator, we can find \\(ln(1.4) = 0.3364\\). Dividing by 10 (since the two dates are 10 years apart), we get an average growth rate of 0.034, or 3.4 percent per year.",

    "text": "10.6 The Solow Growth Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the Solow growth model\n\n\n\nHere we present two formal versions of the mathematics of the model. The first takes as its focus the capital accumulation equation and explains how the capital stock evolves in the economy. This version ignores the role of human capital and ignores the long-run growth path of the economy. The second follows the exposition of the chapter and is based around the derivation of the balanced growth path. They are, however, simply two different ways of approaching the same problem.\nThere are three components of this presentation of the model: technology, capital accumulation, and saving. The first component of the Solow growth model is the specification of technology and comes from the aggregate production function. We express output per worker (y) as a function of capital per worker (k) and technology (A). A mathematical expression of this relationship is \\[y = A \\times f(k)\\]\nwhere f(k) means that output per worker depends on capital per worker. As in our presentation of production functions, output increases with technology. We assume that f() has the properties that more capital leads to more output per capita at a diminishing rate. As an example, suppose \\[y = A\\times k ^{1/3}.\\]\nIn this case the marginal product of capital is positive but diminishing.\nThe second component is capital accumulation. If we let kt be the amount of capital per capita at the start of year t, then we know that \\[k' = (1 − \\delta)k + i,\\] where the “prime” indicates a variable in period \\(t+1\\).\nThis expression shows how the capital stock changes over time. Here \\(\\delta\\) is the rate of physical depreciation so that between year t and year t+1, \\(\\delta k\\) units of capital are lost from depreciation. But during year t, there is investment (\\(i\\)) that yields new capital in the following year.\nThe final component of the Solow growth model is saving. In a closed economy, saving is the same as investment. Thus we link it in the accumulation equation to saving. Assume that saving per capita (\\(s_t\\)) is given by \\[s_t = s × y.\\]\nHere \\(s\\) is a constant between zero and one, so only a fraction of total output is saved.\nUsing the fact that savings equals investment, along with the per capita production function, we can relate investment to the level of capital: \\[i = s\\times A \\times f(k).\\]\nWe can then write the equation for the evolution of the capital stock as follows: \\[k' = k (1 − \\delta) + s \\times A \\times f(k).\\]\nOnce we have specified the function \\(f()\\), we can follow the evolution of the capital stock over time. Generally, the path of the capital stock over time has two important properties:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteady state\n\n\n\nThere is a particular level of the capital stock such that if the economy accumulates that amount of capital, it stays at that level of capital. We call this the steady state level of capital, denoted \\(k^*\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStability\n\n\n\nThe economy will tend toward the per capita capital stock \\(k^*\\).\n\n\nTo be more specific, the steady state level of capital solves the following equation: \\[k^* = k^* \\times (1 − \\delta) + s \\times A \\times f(k^*).\\]\nAt the steady state, the amount of capital lost by depreciation is exactly offset by saving. This means that at the steady state, net investment is exactly zero. The property of stability means that if the current capital stock is below k*, the economy will accumulate capital so that \\(k' &gt; k\\). And if the current capital stock is above \\(k^*\\), the economy will decumulate capital so that \\(k' &lt; k\\).\nIf two countries share the same technology (A) and the same production function \\(f(k)\\), then over time these two countries will eventually have the same stock of capital per worker. If there are differences in the technology or the production function, then there is no reason for the two countries to converge to the same level of capital stock per worker.",

The model takes as given (exogenous) the investment rate; the depreciation rate; and the growth rates of the workforce, human capital, and technology. The endogenous variables are output and physical capital stock.\nThe notation for the presentation is given in Table 31.11 “Notation in the Solow Growth Model”: We use the notation \\(g_x\\) to represent the growth rate of a variable \\(x\\); that is, \\[g_x=\\frac{x'-x}{x} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{x}=\\%\\Delta x.\\]\nThere are two key ingredients to the model: the aggregate production function and the equation for capital accumulation.\n\n\n\nTable 10.6: Notation in the Solow Growth Model\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nSymbol\n\n\n\n\nReal gross domestic product\nY\n\n\nCapital stock\nK\n\n\nHuman capital\nH\n\n\nWorkforce\nL\n\n\nTechnology\nA\n\n\nInvestment rate\ni\n\n\nDepreciation rate\n\\(\\delta\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.9.1 The Production Function\nThe production function we use is the Cobb-Douglas production function:\n\\[Y = A \\times K^\\alpha \\times (HL)^{1−\\alpha}. \\tag{10.1}\\]\nGrowth Accounting\nIf we apply the rules of growth rates to Equation 10.1, we get the following expression:\n\\[g_Y = g_A + \\alpha g_K + (1 - \\alpha)(g_L + g_H). \\tag{10.2}\\]\nBalanced Growth\nThe condition for balanced growth is that\n\\[g_Y = g_K.\\]\nWhen we impose this condition on our equation for the growth rate of output (Equation 10.2), we get:\n\\[g_Y^{BG} = \\alpha g_Y^{BG} + (1 - \\alpha)(g_L + g_H) + g_A,\\]\nwhere the superscript “BG” indicates that we are considering the values of variables when the economy is on a balanced growth path. This equation simplifies to:\n\\[g_Y^{BG} = g_L + g_H + \\frac{g_A}{1 - \\alpha} . \\tag{10.3}\\]\nThe growth in output on a balanced-growth path depends on the growth rates of the workforce, human capital, and technology.\nUsing this, we can rewrite Equation 10.2 as follows:\n\\[g_Y = \\alpha g_K + (1 - \\alpha)g_Y^{BG}. \\tag{10.4}\\]\nThe actual growth rate in output is an average of the balanced-growth rate of output and the growth rate of the capital stock.\nCapital Accumulation\nThe second piece of our model is the capital accumulation equation.\n\\[K' = (1- \\delta)K + I,\\]\nThe growth rate of the capital stock is given by:\n\\[\\frac{K'}{K} = (1- \\delta) + \\frac{I}{K}, \\]\nwhich can be simplified to\n\\[\\frac{K'}{K} -1 = \\frac{I}{K}- \\delta,  \\]\nor with \\(g_K = \\frac{K'-K}{K} = \\frac{K'}{K} -1\\) we get\n\\[g_K = \\frac{I}{K}- \\delta. \\tag{10.5}\\]\nDivide the numerator and denominator of the first term by Y, remembering that (i = I/Y).\n\\[g_K = \\frac{i}{K/Y} - \\delta. \\tag{10.6}\\]\nThe growth rate of the capital stock depends positively on the investment rate and negatively on the depreciation rate. It also depends negatively on the current capital-output ratio.\nThe Balanced-Growth Capital-Output Ratio\nNow rearrange Equation 10.6 to give the ratio of capital to gross domestic product (GDP), given the depreciation rate, the investment rate, and the growth rate of the capital stock:\n\\[\\frac{K}{Y} = i\\delta + g_K.\\]\nWhen the economy is on a balanced growth path, \\(g_K = g_Y^{BG}\\), so:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{K}{Y}\\right)^{BG} = \\frac{i}{\\delta + g_Y^{BG}}.\\]\nWe can also substitute in our balanced-growth expression for \\(\\left(g_Y^{BG}\\right)\\) (Equation 10.3) to get an expression for the balanced-growth capital output ratio in terms of exogenous variables:\n\\[\\left(\\frac{K}{Y}\\right)^{BG}= \\frac{i}{\\delta + g_L + g_H + \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha}g_A}.\\]\nConvergence\nThe proof that economies will converge to the balanced-growth ratio of capital to GDP is relatively straightforward. We want to show that if\n\\[\\frac{K}{Y} &lt; \\left(\\frac{K}{Y}\\right)^{BG},\\]\nthen capital grows faster than output. If capital is growing faster than output, \\(g_K - g_Y &gt; 0\\). First, go back to Equation 10.4:\n\\[g_Y = \\alpha g_K + (1 - \\alpha)g_Y^{BG}.\\]\nSubtract both sides from the growth rate of capital:\n\\[g_K - g_Y = g_K - \\alpha g_K - (1 - \\alpha)g_Y^{BG} = (1 - \\alpha)(g_K - g_Y^{BG}).\\]\nNow compare the general expression for the ratio of capital to GDP with its balanced growth value:\n\\[K/Y = i\\delta + g_K\\text{ (general expression)}\\]\nand\n\\[\\left(\\frac{k}{Y}\\right)^{BG} = \\frac{i}{\\delta + g_Y^{BG}}.\\text{ (balanced growth)}\\]\nIf \\((K/Y &lt; \\left(\\frac{K}{Y}\\right)^{BG}\\), then it must be the case that \\(g_K &gt; g_Y^{BG}\\), which implies (from the previous equation) that \\(g_K &gt; g_Y\\).\nOutput per Worker Growth\nIf we want to examine the growth in output per worker rather than total output, we take the per-worker production function (Equation 10.2) and apply the rules of growth rates to that equation:\n\\[g_{Y/L} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha} g_{K/Y} + g_H + g_A.\\]\n\\[(1 - \\alpha)g_Y = \\alpha[g_K - g_Y] + (1 - \\alpha)[g_L + g_H] + g_A = \\alpha[g_K - g_Y] + (1 - \\alpha)[g_L + g_H] + g_A.\\]\nWe then divide by \\((1 - \\alpha)\\) to get:\n\\[g_Y = \\alpha(1 - \\alpha)[g_K - g_Y] + g_L + g_H + \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha}g_A\\]\nand subtract \\(g_L\\) from each side to obtain:\n\\[g_Y - g_L = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - a}[g_K - g_Y] + g_H + \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha}g_A.\\]\nFinally, we note that \\(g_Y - g_L = g_{Y/L}\\):\n\\[g_{Y/L} = \\frac{\\alpha}{1 - \\alpha}[g_K - g_Y] + g_H + \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha}g_A.\\]\nWith balanced growth, the first term is equal to zero, so:\n\\[g_{Y/L}^{BG} = g_H + \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha}g_A.\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nIn a balanced growth path output and capital grow at the same rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet up the Solow growth model and calculate the steady state of per worker capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Nominal vs. Real GDP\nFigure 10.2: Nominal vs. Real GDP Growth Rates\nFigure 10.3: Not only has the number of calories that people consume per day increased, so has the amount of food calories that people are able to afford based on their working wages.

(a) This aggregate production function has GDP as its output. (b) This aggregate production function has GDP per capita as its output. Because we calculate it on a per-person basis, we already figure the labor input into the other factors and we do not need to list it separately.\nFigure 10.5: Output per hour worked is a measure of worker productivity. In the U.S. economy, worker productivity rose more quickly in the 1960s and the mid-1990s compared with the 1970s and 1980s. However, these growth-rate differences are only a few percentage points per year. Look carefully to see them in the changing slope of the line. The average U.S. worker produced over twice as much per hour in 2014 than he did in the early 1970s. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\nFigure 10.6: U.S. growth in worker productivity was very high between 1950 and 1970. It then declined to lower levels in the 1970s and the 1980s. The late 1990s and early 2000s saw productivity rebound, but then productivity sagged a bit in the 2000s. Some think the productivity rebound of the late 1990s and early 2000s marks the start of a “new economy” built on higher productivity growth, but we cannot determine this until more time has passed. (Source: U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics.)\nFigure 10.7: Rising levels of education for persons 25 and older show the deepening of human capital in the U.S. economy. Even today, under one-third of U.S. adults have completed a four-year college degree. There is clearly room for additional deepening of human capital to occur. (Source: US Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics)\nFigure 10.8: The value of the physical capital, measured by plant and equipment, used by the average worker in the U.S. economy has risen over the decades. The increase may have leveled off a bit in the 1970s and 1980s, which were, not coincidentally, times of slower-than-usual growth in worker productivity. We see a renewed increase in physical capital per worker in the late 1990s, followed by a flattening in the early 2000s. (Source: Center for International Comparisons of Production, Income and Prices, University of Pennsylvania)\nFigure 10.9: Imagine that the economy starts at point R, with the level of physical and human capital C1 and the output per capita at G1. If the economy relies only on capital deepening, while remaining at the technology level shown by the Technology 1 line, then it would face diminishing marginal returns as it moved from point R to point U to point W. However, now imagine that capital deepening is combined with improvements in technology. Then, as capital deepens from C1 to C2, technology improves from Technology 1 to Technology 2, and the economy moves from R to S. Similarly, as capital deepens from C2 to C3, technology increases from Technology 2 to Technology 3, and the economy moves from S to T. With improvements in technology, there is no longer any reason that economic growth must necessarily slow down.",

Say’s law is: “Supply creates its own demand.” As a matter of historical accuracy, it seems clear that Say never actually wrote down this law and that it oversimplifies his beliefs, but the law lives on as useful shorthand for summarizing a point of view.\nThe intuition behind Say’s law is that each time a good or service is produced and sold, it generates income that is earned for someone: a worker, a manager, an owner, or those who are workers, managers, and owners at firms that supply inputs along the chain of production. The forces of supply and demand in individual markets will cause prices to rise and fall. The bottom line remains, however, that every sale represents income to someone, and so, Say’s law argues, a given value of supply must create an equivalent value of demand somewhere else in the economy. Because Jean-Baptiste Say, Adam Smith, and other economists writing around the turn of the nineteenth century who discussed this view were known as “classical” economists, modern economists who generally subscribe to the Say’s law view on the importance of supply for determining the size of the macroeconomy are called neoclassical economists.\nIf supply always creates exactly enough demand at the macroeconomic level, then (as Say himself recognized) it is hard to understand why periods of recession and high unemployment should ever occur. To be sure, even if total supply always creates an equal amount of total demand, the economy could still experience a situation of some firms earning profits while other firms suffer losses. Nevertheless, a recession is not a situation where all business failures are exactly counterbalanced by an offsetting number of successes. A recession is a situation in which the economy as a whole is shrinking in size, business failures outnumber the remaining success stories, and many firms end up suffering losses and laying off workers.\nSay’s law that supply creates its own demand does seem a good approximation for the long run. Over periods of some years or decades, as the productive power of an economy to supply goods and services increases, total demand in the economy grows at roughly the same pace. However, over shorter time horizons of a few months or even years, recessions or even depressions occur in which firms, as a group, seem to face a lack of demand for their products.\n\n\n11.1.2 Keynes’ Law and the Macroeconomics of Demand\nThe alternative to Say’s law, with its emphasis on supply, can be named Keynes’ law: “Demand creates its own supply.” As a matter of historical accuracy, just as Jean-Baptiste Say never wrote down anything as simpleminded as Say’s law, John Maynard Keynes never wrote down Keynes’ law, but the law is a useful simplification that conveys a certain point of view.\nWhen Keynes wrote his great work The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money during the Great Depression of the 1930s, he pointed out that during the Depression, the capacity of the economy to supply goods and services had not changed much. U.S. unemployment rates soared higher than 20% from 1933 to 1935, but the number of possible workers had not increased or decreased much. Factories were closed and shuttered, but machinery and equipment had not disappeared. Technologies that had been invented in the 1920s were not un-invented and forgotten in the 1930s. Thus, Keynes argued that the Great Depression—and many ordinary recessions as well—were not caused by a drop in the ability of the economy to supply goods as measured by labor, physical capital, or technology. He argued the economy often produced less than its full potential, not because it was technically impossible to produce more with the existing workers and machines, but because a lack of demand in the economy as a whole led to inadequate incentives for firms to produce. In such cases, he argued, the level of GDP in the economy was not primarily determined by the potential of what the economy could supply, but rather by the amount of total demand.\nKeynes’ law seems to apply fairly well in the short run of a few months to a few years, when many firms experience either a drop in demand for their output during a recession or so much demand that they have trouble producing enough during an economic boom. However, demand cannot tell the whole macroeconomic story, either. After all, if demand was all that mattered at the macroeconomic level, then the government could make the economy as large as it wanted just by pumping up total demand through a large increase in the government spending component or by legislating large tax cuts to push up the consumption component. Economies do, however, face genuine limits to how much they can produce, limits determined by the quantity of labor, physical capital, technology, and the institutional and market structures that bring these factors of production together. These constraints on what an economy can supply at the macroeconomic level do not disappear just because of an increase in demand.\n\n\n11.1.3 Combining Supply and Demand in Macroeconomics\nTwo insights emerge from this overview of Say’s law with its emphasis on macroeconomic supply and Keynes’ law with its emphasis on macroeconomic demand. The first conclusion, which is not exactly a hot news flash, is that an economic approach focused only on the supply side or only on the demand side can be only a partial success. Both supply and demand need to be taken into account. The second conclusion is that since Keynes’ law applies more accurately in the short run and Say’s law applies more accurately in the long run, the tradeoffs and connections between the three goals of macroeconomics may be different in the short run and the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nNeoclassical economists emphasize Say’s law, which holds that supply creates its own demand.\nKeynesian economists emphasize Keynes’ law, which holds that demand creates its own supply.\nMany mainstream economists take a Keynesian perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate demand, for the short run, and a neoclassical perspective, emphasizing the importance of aggregate supply, for the long run.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the mechanism by which supply creates its own demand.\nDescribe the mechanism by which demand creates its own supply.\nWhat is Say’s law?\nDo neoclassical economists believe in Keynes’ law or Say’s law?",

    "text": "11.2 Building a Model of Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the aggregate supply curve and how it relates to real GDP and potential GDP\nExplain the aggregate demand curve and how it is influenced by price levels\nInterpret the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\nIdentify the point of equilibrium in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\nDefine short run aggregate supply and long run aggregate supply\n\n\n\nTo build a useful macroeconomic model, we need a model that shows what determines total supply or total demand for the economy, and how total demand and total supply interact at the macroeconomic level. This model is called the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model. This module will explain aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the equilibrium between them. The following modules will discuss the causes of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand.\n\n11.2.1 The Aggregate Supply Curve and Potential GDP\nFirms make decisions about what quantity to supply based on the profits they expect to earn. Profits, in turn, are also determined by the price of the outputs the firm sells and by the price of the inputs, like labor or raw materials, the firm needs to buy. Aggregate supply (AS) refers to the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) firms will produce and sell. The aggregate supply (AS) curve shows the total quantity of output (i.e. real GDP) that firms will produce and sell at each price level.\nFigure 11.1 shows an aggregate supply curve. In the following paragraphs, we will walk through the elements of the diagram one at a time: the horizontal and vertical axes, the aggregate supply curve itself, and the meaning of the potential GDP vertical line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more and to earn higher profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical capital.\n\n\n\nThe horizontal axis of the diagram shows real GDP—that is, the level of GDP adjusted for inflation. The vertical axis shows the price level. Remember that the price level is different from the inflation rate. Visualize the price level as an index number, like the GDP deflator, while the inflation rate is the percentage change between price levels over time.\nAs the price level (the average price of all goods and services produced in the economy) rises, the aggregate quantity of goods and services supplied rises as well. Why? The price level shown on the vertical axis represents prices for final goods or outputs bought in the economy—like the GDP deflator—not the price level for intermediate goods and services that are inputs to production. Thus, the AS curve describes how suppliers will react to a higher price level for final outputs of goods and services, while holding the prices of inputs like labor and energy constant. If firms across the economy face a situation where the price level of what they produce and sell is rising, but their costs of production are not rising, then the lure of higher profits will induce them to expand production.\nThe slope of an AS curve changes from nearly flat at its far left to nearly vertical at its far right. At the far left of the aggregate supply curve, the level of output in the economy is far below potential GDP, which is defined as the quantity that an economy can produce by fully employing its existing levels of labor, physical capital, and technology, in the context of its existing market and legal institutions. At these relatively low levels of output, levels of unemployment are high, and many factories are running only part-time, or have closed their doors. In this situation, a relatively small increase in the prices of the outputs that businesses sell—while making the assumption of no rise in input prices—can encourage a considerable surge in the quantity of aggregate supply because so many workers and factories are ready to swing into production.\n\nVideo - Aggregate Supply\n\n    \n\n\nAs the quantity produced increases, however, certain firms and industries will start running into limits: perhaps nearly all of the expert workers in a certain industry will have jobs or factories in certain geographic areas or industries will be running at full speed. In the intermediate area of the AS curve, a higher price level for outputs continues to encourage a greater quantity of output—but as the increasingly steep upward slope of the aggregate supply curve shows, the increase in quantity in response to a given rise in the price level will not be quite as large. (Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn why the AS curve crosses potential GDP.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHY DOES AS-CURVE CROSS POTENTIAL GDP?\nThe aggregate supply curve is typically drawn to cross the potential GDP line. This shape may seem puzzling: How can an economy produce at an output level which is higher than its “potential” or “full employment” GDP? The economic intuition here is that if prices for outputs were high enough, producers would make fanatical efforts to produce: all workers would be on double-overtime, all machines would run 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Such hyper-intense production would go beyond using potential labor and physical capital resources fully, to using them in a way that is not sustainable in the long term. Thus, it is indeed possible for production to sprint above potential GDP, but only in the short run.\n\n\nAt the far right, the aggregate supply curve becomes nearly vertical. At this quantity, higher prices for outputs cannot encourage additional output, because even if firms want to expand output, the inputs of labor and machinery in the economy are fully employed. In this example, the vertical line in the exhibit shows that potential GDP occurs at a total output of 9,500. When an economy is operating at its potential GDP, machines and factories are running at capacity, and the unemployment rate is relatively low—at the natural rate of unemployment. For this reason, potential GDP is sometimes also called full-employment GDP.\n\n\n11.2.2 The Aggregate Demand Curve\nAggregate demand (AD) refers to the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy. (Strictly speaking, AD is what economists call total planned expenditure. This distinction will be further explained in the appendix The Expenditure-Output Model . For now, just think of aggregate demand as total spending.) It includes all four components of demand: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports (exports minus imports). This demand is determined by a number of factors, but one of them is the price level—recall though, that the price level is an index number such as the GDP deflator that measures the average price of the things we buy. The aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the total spending on domestic goods and services at each price level.\nFigure 11.2 presents an aggregate demand (AD) curve. Just like the aggregate supply curve, the horizontal axis shows real GDP and the vertical axis shows the price level. The AD curve slopes down, which means that increases in the price level of outputs lead to a lower quantity of total spending. The reasons behind this shape are related to how changes in the price level affect the different components of aggregate demand. The following components make up aggregate demand: consumption spending (C), investment spending (I), government spending (G), and spending on exports (X) minus imports (M): C + I + G + X – M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.2: Aggregate demand (AD) slopes down, showing that, as the price level rises, the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services declines.\n\n\n\n\nThe wealth effect holds that as the price level increases, the buying power of savings that people have stored up in bank accounts and other assets will diminish, eaten away to some extent by inflation. Because a rise in the price level reduces people’s wealth, consumption spending will fall as the price level rises.\nThe interest rate effect is that as prices for outputs rise, the same purchases will take more money or credit to accomplish. This additional demand for money and credit will push interest rates higher. In turn, higher interest rates will reduce borrowing by businesses for investment purposes and reduce borrowing by households for homes and cars—thus reducing consumption and investment spending.\nThe foreign price effect points out that if prices rise in the United States while remaining fixed in other countries, then goods in the United States will be relatively more expensive compared to goods in the rest of the world. U.S. exports will be relatively more expensive, and the quantity of exports sold will fall. U.S. imports from abroad will be relatively cheaper, so the quantity of imports will rise. Thus, a higher domestic price level, relative to price levels in other countries, will reduce net export expenditures.\n\nTruth be told, among economists all three of these effects are controversial, in part because they do not seem to be very large. For this reason, the aggregate demand curve in Figure slopes downward fairly steeply; the steep slope indicates that a higher price level for final outputs reduces aggregate demand for all three of these reasons, but that the change in the quantity of aggregate demand as a result of changes in price level is not very large.\nRead the following Work It Out feature to learn how to interpret the AD/AS model. In this example, aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the price level are given for the imaginary country of Xurbia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nINTERPRETING THE AD/AS MODEL\nThe following table shows information on aggregate supply, aggregate demand, and the price level for the imaginary country of Xurbia. What information does Table tell you about the state of the Xurbia’s economy? Where is the equilibrium price level and output level (this is the SR macroequilibrium)? Is Xurbia risking inflationary pressures or facing high unemployment? How can you tell?\n\n\n\nPrice Level\nAggregate Demand\nAggregate Supply\n\n\n\n\n110\n$700\n$600\n\n\n120\n$690\n$640\n\n\n130\n$680\n$680\n\n\n140\n$670\n$720\n\n\n150\n$660\n$740\n\n\n160\n$650\n$760\n\n\n170\n$640\n$770\n\n\n\nTo begin to use the AD/AS model, it is important to plot the AS and AD curves from the data provided. What is the equilibrium?\nStep 1: Draw your x- and y-axis. Label the x-axis Real GDP and the y-axis Price Level.\nStep 2: Plot AD on your graph.\nStep 3: Plot AS on your graph.\nStep 4: Look at Figure 11.3 which provides a visual to aid in your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.3\n\n\n\nStep 5: Determine where AD and AS intersect. This is the equilibrium with price level at 130 and real GDP at $680.\nStep 6: Look at the graph to determine where equilibrium is located. We can see that this equilibrium is fairly far from where the AS curve becomes near-vertical (or at least quite steep) which seems to start at about $750 of real output. This implies that the economy is not close to potential GDP. Thus, unemployment will be high. In the relatively flat part of the AS curve, where the equilibrium occurs, changes in the price level will not be a major concern, since such changes are likely to be small.\nStep 7: Determine what the steep portion of the AS curve indicates. Where the AS curve is steep, the economy is at or close to potential GDP.\nStep 8: Draw conclusions from the given information:\n\n\nIf equilibrium occurs in the flat range of AS, then economy is not close to potential GDP and will be experiencing unemployment, but stable price level.\nIf equilibrium occurs in the steep range of AS, then the economy is close or at potential GDP and will be experiencing rising price levels or inflationary pressures, but will have a low unemployment rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Equilibrium in the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nThe intersection of the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves shows the equilibrium level of real GDP and the equilibrium price level in the economy. At a relatively low price level for output, firms have little incentive to produce, although consumers would be willing to purchase a high quantity. As the price level for outputs rises, aggregate supply rises and aggregate demand falls until the equilibrium point is reached.\nFigure Figure 11.4 combines the AS curve from Figure 11.1 and the AD curve from Figure 11.2 and places them both on a single diagram. In this example, the equilibrium point occurs at point E, at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.4: The equilibrium, where aggregate supply (AS) equals aggregate demand (AD), occurs at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.\n\n\n\nConfusion sometimes arises between the aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital. Read the following Clear It Up feature to gain an understanding of whether AS and AD are macro or micro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nARE Aggregate Supply (AS) AND Aggregate Demand (AD) MACRO OR MICRO?\nThese aggregate supply and aggregate demand model and the microeconomic analysis of demand and supply in particular markets for goods, services, labor, and capital have a superficial resemblance, but they also have many underlying differences.\nFor example, the vertical and horizontal axes have distinctly different meanings in macroeconomic and microeconomic diagrams. The vertical axis of a microeconomic demand and supply diagram expresses a price (or wage or rate of return) for an individual good or service. This price is implicitly relative: it is intended to be compared with the prices of other products (for example, the price of pizza relative to the price of fried chicken). In contrast, the vertical axis of an aggregate supply and aggregate demand diagram expresses the level of a price index like the Consumer Price Index or the GDP deflator—combining a wide array of prices from across the economy. The price level is absolute: it is not intended to be compared to any other prices since it is essentially the average price of all products in an economy. The horizontal axis of a microeconomic supply and demand curve measures the quantity of a particular good or service. In contrast, the horizontal axis of the aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram measures GDP, which is the sum of all the final goods and services produced in the economy, not the quantity in a specific market.\nIn addition, the economic reasons for the shapes of the curves in the macroeconomic model are different from the reasons behind the shapes of the curves in microeconomic models. Demand curves for individual goods or services slope down primarily because of the existence of substitute goods, not the wealth effects, interest rate, and foreign price effects associated with aggregate demand curves. The slopes of individual supply and demand curves can have a variety of different slopes, depending on the extent to which quantity demanded and quantity supplied react to price in that specific market, but the slopes of the AS and AD curves are much the same in every diagram (although as we shall see in later chapters, short-run and long-run perspectives will emphasize different parts of the AS curve).\nIn short, just because the AD/AS diagram has two lines that cross, do not assume that it is the same as every other diagram where two lines cross. The intuitions and meanings of the macro and micro diagrams are only distant cousins from different branches of the economics family tree.\n\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Defining SRAS and LRAS\nIn the Clear It Up feature titled “Why does AS cross potential GDP?” we differentiated between short run changes in aggregate supply which are shown by the AS curve and long run changes in aggregate supply which are defined by the vertical line at potential GDP.\n\nVideo - Short-Run Aggregate Supply\n\n    \n\n\nIn the short run, if demand is too low (or too high), it is possible for producers to supply less GDP (or more GDP) than potential.\nIn the long run, however, producers are limited to producing at potential GDP. For this reason, what we have been calling the AS curve, will from this point on may also be referred to as the short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve. The vertical line at potential GDP may also be referred to as the long run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe upward-sloping short run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve shows the positive relationship between the price level and the level of real GDP in the short run.\nAggregate supply slopes up because when the price level for outputs increases, while the price level of inputs remains fixed, the opportunity for additional profits encourages more production. The aggregate supply curve is near-horizontal on the left and near-vertical on the right.\nIn the long run, aggregate supply is shown by a vertical line at the level of potential output, which is the maximum level of output the economy can produce with its existing levels of workers, physical capital, technology, and economic institutions.\nThe downward-sloping aggregate demand (AD) curve shows the relationship between the price level for outputs and the quantity of total spending in the economy. It slopes down because of:\n\n\nthe wealth effect, which means that a higher price level leads to lower real wealth, which reduces the level of consumption;\nthe interest rate effect, which holds that a higher price level will mean a greater demand for money, which will tend to drive up interest rates and reduce investment spending; and\nthe foreign price effect, which holds that a rise in the price level will make domestic goods relatively more expensive, discouraging exports and encouraging imports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe short run aggregate supply curve was constructed assuming that as the price of outputs increases, the price of inputs stays the same. How would an increase in the prices of important inputs, like energy, affect aggregate supply?\nIn the AD/AS model, what prevents the economy from achieving equilibrium at potential output?\nWhat is on the horizontal axis of the AD/AS diagram? What is on the vertical axis?",

    "text": "11.3 Shifts in Aggregate Supply\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain how productivity growth changes the aggregate supply curve\nExplain how changes in input prices changes the aggregate supply curve\n\n\n\nThe original equilibrium in the AD/AS diagram will shift to a new equilibrium if the AS or AD curve shifts. When the aggregate supply curve shifts to the right, then at every price level, a greater quantity of real GDP is produced. When the SRAS curve shifts to the left, then at every price level, a lower quantity of real GDP is produced. This module discusses two of the most important factors that can lead to shifts in the AS curve: productivity growth and input prices.\n\n11.3.1 How Productivity Growth Shifts the AS Curve\nIn the long run, the most important factor shifting the AS curve is productivity growth. Productivity means how much output can be produced with a given quantity of labor. One measure of this is output per worker or GDP per capita. Over time, productivity grows so that the same quantity of labor can produce more output. Historically, the real growth in GDP per capita in an advanced economy like the United States has averaged about 2% to 3% per year, but productivity growth has been faster during certain extended periods like the 1960s and the late 1990s through the early 2000s, or slower during periods like the 1970s.\nA higher level of productivity shifts the AS curve to the right, because with improved productivity, firms can produce a greater quantity of output at every price level. Figure 11.5 (a) shows an outward shift in productivity over two time periods. The AS curve shifts out from SRAS0 to SRAS1 to SRAS2, reflecting the rise in potential GDP in this economy, and the equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1 to E2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.5: Panel (a): The rise in productivity causes the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The original equilibrium E0 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS0. When SRAS shifts right, then the new equilibrium E1 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS1, and then yet another equilibrium, E2, is at the intersection of AD and SRAS2. Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and to downward pressure on the price level. Panel (b): A higher price for inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower quantity will be produced so aggregate supply will shift to the left from SRAS0 to AS1. The new equilibrium, E1, has a reduced quantity of output and a higher price level than the original equilibrium (E0).\n\n\n\nA shift in the SRAS curve to the right will result in a greater real GDP and downward pressure on the price level, if aggregate demand remains unchanged. However, if this shift in SRAS results from gains in productivity growth, which are typically measured in terms of a few percentage points per year, the effect will be relatively small over a few months or even a couple of years.\n\n\n11.3.2 How Changes in Input Prices Shift the AS Curve\nHigher prices for inputs that are widely used across the entire economy can have a macroeconomic impact on aggregate supply. Examples of such widely used inputs include wages and energy products. Increases in the price of such inputs will cause the SRAS curve to shift to the left, which means that at each given price level for outputs, a higher price for inputs will discourage production because it will reduce the possibilities for earning profits. Figure 11.5 (b) shows the aggregate supply curve shifting to the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, causing the equilibrium to move from E0 to E1.\nThe movement from the original equilibrium of E0 to the new equilibrium of E1 will bring a nasty set of effects: reduced GDP or recession, higher unemployment because the economy is now further away from potential GDP, and an inflationary higher price level as well. For example, the U.S. economy experienced recessions in 1974–1975, 1980–1982, 1990–91, 2001, and 2007–2009 that were each preceded or accompanied by a rise in the key input of oil prices. In the 1970s, this pattern of a shift to the left in SRAS leading to a stagnant economy with high unemployment and inflation was nicknamed stagflation.\nConversely, a decline in the price of a key input like oil will shift the SRAS curve to the right, providing an incentive for more to be produced at every given price level for outputs. From 1985 to 1986, for example, the average price of crude oil fell by almost half, from $24 a barrel to $12 a barrel. Similarly, from 1997 to 1998, the price of a barrel of crude oil dropped from $17 per barrel to $11 per barrel. In both cases, the plummeting price of oil led to a situation like that presented earlier in Figure 11.5 (a), where the outward shift of SRAS to the right allowed the economy to expand, unemployment to fall, and inflation to decline.\nAlong with energy prices, two other key inputs that may shift the SRAS curve are the cost of labor, or wages, and the cost of imported goods that are used as inputs for other products. In these cases as well, the lesson is that lower prices for inputs cause SRAS to shift to the right, while higher prices cause it to shift back to the left.\n\n\n11.3.3 Other Supply Shocks\nThe aggregate supply curve can also shift due to shocks to input goods or labor. For example, an unexpected early freeze could destroy a large number of agricultural crops, a shock that would shift the AS curve to the left since there would be fewer agricultural products available at any given price.\nSimilarly, shocks to the labor market can affect aggregate supply. An extreme example might be an overseas war that required a large number of workers to cease their ordinary production in order to go fight for their country. In this case, aggregate supply would shift to the left because there would be fewer workers available to produce goods at any given price.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS) diagram shows how AD and AS interact.\nThe intersection of the AD and AS curves shows the equilibrium output and price level in the economy. Movements of either AS or AD will result in a different equilibrium output and price level.\nThe aggregate supply curve will shift out to the right as productivity increases. It will shift back to the left as the price of key inputs rises, and will shift out to the right if the price of key inputs falls.\nIf the AS curve shifts back to the left, the combination of lower output, higher unemployment, and higher inflation, called stagflation, occurs.\nIf AS shifts out to the right, a combination of lower inflation, higher output, and lower unemployment is possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose the U.S. Congress passes significant immigration reform that makes it easier for foreigners to come to the United States to work. Use the AD/AS model to explain how this would affect the equilibrium level of GDP and the price level.\nSuppose concerns about the size of the federal budget deficit lead the U.S. Congress to cut all funding for research and development for ten years. Assuming this has an impact on technology growth, what does the AD/AS model predict would be the likely effect on equilibrium GDP and the price level?\nName some factors that could cause the SRAS curve to shift, and say whether they would shift SRAS to the right or to the left.\nWill the shift of SRAS to the right tend to make the equilibrium quantity and price level higher or lower? What about a shift of SRAS to the left?",

(Read the following Clear It Up feature for explanation of why imports are subtracted from exports and what this means for aggregate demand.)\nA shift of the AD curve to the right means that at least one of these components increased so that a greater amount of total spending would occur at every price level.\nA shift of the AD curve to the left means that at least one of these components decreased so that a lesser amount of total spending would occur at every price level. The Keynesian Perspective will discuss the components of aggregate demand and the factors that affect them. Here, the discussion will sketch two broad categories that could cause AD curves to shift: changes in the behavior of consumers or firms and changes in government tax or spending policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDO IMPORTS DIMINISH AGGREGATE DEMAND?\nWe have seen that the formula for aggregate demand is AD = C + I + G + X - M, where M is the total value of imported goods. Why is there a minus sign in front of imports? Does this mean that more imports will result in a lower level of aggregate demand?\nWhen an American buys a foreign product, for example, it gets counted along with all the other consumption. So the income generated does not go to American producers, but rather to producers in another country; it would be wrong to count this as part of domestic demand. Therefore, imports added in consumption are subtracted back out in the M term of the equation.\nBecause of the way in which the demand equation is written, it is easy to make the mistake of thinking that imports are bad for the economy. Just keep in mind that every negative number in the M term has a corresponding positive number in the C or I or G term, and they always cancel out.\n\n\n\n11.4.1 How Changes by Consumers and Firms Can Affect AD\nWhen consumers feel more confident about the future of the economy, they tend to consume more. If business confidence is high, then firms tend to spend more on investment, believing that the future payoff from that investment will be substantial. Conversely, if consumer or business confidence drops, then consumption and investment spending decline.\nThe University of Michigan publishes a survey of consumer confidence and constructs an index of consumer confidence each month. The survey results are then reported at http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu, which break down the change in consumer confidence among different income levels. According to that index, consumer confidence averaged around 90 prior to the Great Recession, and then it fell to below 60 in late 2008, which was the lowest it had been since 1980. Since then, confidence has climbed from a 2011 low of 55.8 back to a level in the low 80s, which is considered close to being considered a healthy state.\nOne measure of business confidence is published by the OECD: the \"business tendency surveys\". Business opinion survey data are collected for 21 countries on future selling prices and employment, among other elements of the business climate. After sharply declining during the Great Recession, the measure has risen above zero again and is back to long-term averages (the indicator dips below zero when business outlook is weaker than usual). Of course, either of these survey measures is not very precise. They can however, suggest when confidence is rising or falling, as well as when it is relatively high or low compared to the past.\nBecause a rise in confidence is associated with higher consumption and investment demand, it will lead to an outward shift in the AD curve, and a move of the equilibrium, from E0 to E1, to a higher quantity of output and a higher price level, as shown in Figure 11.6 (a).\nConsumer and business confidence often reflect macroeconomic realities; for example, confidence is usually high when the economy is growing briskly and low during a recession. However, economic confidence can sometimes rise or fall for reasons that do not have a close connection to the immediate economy, like a risk of war, election results, foreign policy events, or a pessimistic prediction about the future by a prominent public figure. U.S. presidents, for example, must be careful in their public pronouncements about the economy. If they offer economic pessimism, they risk provoking a decline in confidence that reduces consumption and investment and shifts AD to the left, and in a self-fulfilling prophecy, contributes to causing the recession that the president warned against in the first place. A shift of AD to the left, and the corresponding movement of the equilibrium, from E0 to E1, to a lower quantity of output and a lower price level, is shown in Figure 11.6 (b).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.6: Panel (a): An increase in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift AD to the right, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the right, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a higher quantity of output and also a higher price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new equilibrium (E1) is also closer to potential GDP. An increase in government spending or a cut in taxes that leads to a rise in consumer spending can also shift AD to the right. Panel (b): A decrease in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift AD to the left, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the left, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a lower quantity of output and also a lower price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new equilibrium (E1) is also farther below potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes that leads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to the left.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.2 How Government Macroeconomic Policy Choices Can Shift AD\nGovernment spending is one component of AD. Thus, higher government spending will cause AD to shift to the right, as in Figure (a), while lower government spending will cause AD to shift to the left, as in Figure (b). For example, in the United States, government spending declined by 3.2% of GDP during the 1990s, from 21% of GDP in 1991, and to 17.8% of GDP in 1998. However, from 2005 to 2009, the peak of the Great Recession, government spending increased from 19% of GDP to 21.4% of GDP. If changes of a few percentage points of GDP seem small to you, remember that since GDP was about $14.4 trillion in 2009, a seemingly small change of 2% of GDP is equal to close to $300 billion.\nTax policy can affect consumption and investment spending, too. Tax cuts for individuals will tend to increase consumption demand, while tax increases will tend to diminish it. Tax policy can also pump up investment demand by offering lower tax rates for corporations or tax reductions that benefit specific kinds of investment. Shifting C or I will shift the AD curve as a whole.\nDuring a recession, when unemployment is high and many businesses are suffering low profits or even losses, the U.S. Congress often passes tax cuts. During the recession of 2001, for example, a tax cut was enacted into law. At such times, the political rhetoric often focuses on how people going through hard times need relief from taxes. The aggregate supply and aggregate demand framework, however, offers a complementary rationale, as illustrated in Figure. The original equilibrium during a recession is at point E0, relatively far from the full employment level of output. The tax cut, by increasing consumption, shifts the AD curve to the right. At the new equilibrium (E1), real GDP rises and unemployment falls and, because in this diagram the economy has not yet reached its potential or full employment level of GDP, any rise in the price level remains muted. Read the following Clear It Up feature to consider the question of whether economists favor tax cuts or oppose them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.7: Whether the economy is in a recession is illustrated in the AD/AS model by how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as indicated by the vertical LRAS line. In this example, the level of output Y0 at the equilibrium E0 is relatively far from the potential GDP line, so it can represent an economy in recession, well below the full employment level of GDP. In contrast, the level of output Y1 at the equilibrium E1 is relatively close to potential GDP, and so it would represent an economy with a lower unemployment rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDO ECONOMISTS FAVOR TAX CUTS OR OPPOSE THEM?\nOne of the most fundamental divisions in American politics over the last few decades has been between those who believe that the government should cut taxes substantially and those who disagree. Ronald Reagan rode into the presidency in 1980 partly because of his promise, soon carried out, to enact a substantial tax cut. George Bush lost his bid for reelection against Bill Clinton in 1992 partly because he had broken his 1988 promise: “Read my lips! No new taxes!” In the 2000 presidential election, both George W. Bush and Al Gore advocated substantial tax cuts and Bush succeeded in pushing a package of tax cuts through Congress early in 2001. Disputes over tax cuts often ignite at the state and local level as well.\nWhat side are economists on? Do they support broad tax cuts or oppose them? The answer, unsatisfying to zealots on both sides, is that it depends. One issue is whether the tax cuts are accompanied by equally large government spending cuts. Economists differ, as does any broad cross-section of the public, on how large government spending should be and what programs might be cut back. A second issue, more relevant to the discussion in this chapter, concerns how close the economy is to the full employment level of output. In a recession, when the intersection of the AD and AS curves is far below the full employment level, tax cuts can make sense as a way of shifting AD to the right. However, when the economy is already doing extremely well, tax cuts may shift AD so far to the right as to generate inflationary pressures, with little gain to GDP.\nWith the AD/AS framework in mind, many economists might readily believe that the Reagan tax cuts of 1981, which took effect just after two serious recessions, were beneficial economic policy. Similarly, the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and the Obama tax cuts of 2009 were enacted during recessions. However, some of the same economists who favor tax cuts in time of recession would be much more dubious about identical tax cuts at a time the economy is performing well and cyclical unemployment is low.\n\n\n\nVideo - Shifts in Aggregate Demand and Supply\n\n    \n\n\nThe use of government spending and tax cuts can be a useful tool to affect aggregate demand and it will be discussed in greater detail in the Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy chapter and The Impacts of Government Borrowing. Other policy tools can shift the aggregate demand curve as well. For example, as discussed in the Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation chapter, the Federal Reserve can affect interest rates and the availability of credit. Higher interest rates tend to discourage borrowing and thus reduce both household spending on big-ticket items like houses and cars and investment spending by business. Conversely, lower interest rates will stimulate consumption and investment demand. Interest rates can also affect exchange rates, which in turn will have effects on the export and import components of aggregate demand.\nSpelling out the details of these alternative policies and how they affect the components of aggregate demand can wait for The Keynesian Perspective chapter. Here, the key lesson is that a shift of the aggregate demand curve to the right leads to a greater real GDP and to upward pressure on the price level. Conversely, a shift of aggregate demand to the left leads to a lower real GDP and a lower price level. Whether these changes in output and price level are relatively large or relatively small, and how the change in equilibrium relates to potential GDP, depends on whether the shift in the AD curve is happening in the relatively flat or relatively steep portion of the AS curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe AD curve will shift out as the components of aggregate demand—C, I, G, and X–M—rise. It will shift back to the left as these components fall. These factors can change because of different personal choices, like those resulting from consumer or business confidence, or from policy choices like changes in government spending and taxes. If the AD curve shifts to the right, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will rise. If the AD curve shifts to the left, then the equilibrium quantity of output and the price level will fall. Whether equilibrium output changes relatively more than the price level or whether the price level changes relatively more than output is determined by where the AD curve intersects with the AS curve.\nThe AD/AS diagram superficially resembles the microeconomic supply and demand diagram on the surface, but in reality, what is on the horizontal and vertical axes and the underlying economic reasons for the shapes of the curves are very different. Long-term economic growth is illustrated in the AD/AS framework by a gradual shift of the aggregate supply curve to the right. A recession is illustrated when the intersection of AD and AS is substantially below potential GDP, while an expanding economy is illustrated when the intersection of AS and AD is near potential GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would a dramatic increase in the value of the stock market shift the AD curve? What effect would the shift have on the equilibrium level of GDP and the price level?\nSuppose Mexico, one of our largest trading partners and purchaser of a large quantity of our exports, goes into a recession. Use the AD/AS model to determine the likely impact on our equilibrium GDP and price level.\nA policymaker claims that tax cuts led the economy out of a recession. Can we use the AD/AS diagram to show this?\nMany financial analysts and economists eagerly await the press releases for the reports on the home price index and consumer confidence index. What would be the effects of a negative report on both of these? What about a positive report?",

    "text": "11.5 How the AD/AS Model Incorporates Growth, Unemployment, and Inflation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nIdentify periods of economic growth and recession using the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\nExplain how unemployment and inflation impact the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\nEvaluate the importance of the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\n\n\n\nThe AD/AS model can convey a number of interlocking relationships between the four macroeconomic goals of growth, unemployment, inflation, and a sustainable balance of trade. Moreover, the AD/AS framework is flexible enough to accommodate both the Keynes’ law approach that focuses on aggregate demand and the short run, while also including the Say’s law approach that focuses on aggregate supply and the long run. These advantages are considerable.\nEvery model is a simplified version of the deeper reality and, in the context of the AD/AS model, the three macroeconomic goals arise in ways that are sometimes indirect or incomplete. In this module, we consider how the AD/AS model illustrates the three macroeconomic goals of economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.\n\n11.5.1 Growth and Recession in the AD/AS Diagram\nIn the AD/AS diagram, long-run economic growth due to productivity increases over time will be represented by a gradual shift to the right of aggregate supply. The vertical line representing potential GDP (or the “full employment level of GDP”) will gradually shift to the right over time as well. A pattern of economic growth over three years, with the AS curve shifting slightly out to the right each year, was shown earlier in [link] (a). However, the factors that determine the speed of this long-term economic growth rate—like investment in physical and human capital, technology, and whether an economy can take advantage of catch-up growth—do not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram.\nIn the short run, GDP falls and rises in every economy, as the economy dips into recession or expands out of recession. Recessions are illustrated in the AD/AS diagram when the equilibrium level of real GDP is substantially below potential GDP, as occurred at the equilibrium point E0 in [link]. On the other hand, in years of resurgent economic growth the equilibrium will typically be close to potential GDP, as shown at equilibrium point E1 in that earlier figure.\n\n\n11.5.2 Unemployment in the AD/AS Diagram\nTwo types of unemployment were described in the Unemployment chapter. Cyclical unemployment bounces up and down according to the short-run movements of GDP. Over the long run, in the United States, the unemployment rate typically hovers around 5% (give or take one percentage point or so), when the economy is healthy.\nIn many of the national economies across Europe, the rate of unemployment in recent decades has only dropped to about 10% or a bit lower, even in good economic years. This baseline level of unemployment that occurs year-in and year-out is called the natural rate of unemployment and is determined by how well the structures of market and government institutions in the economy lead to a matching of workers and employers in the labor market. Potential GDP can imply different unemployment rates in different economies, depending on the natural rate of unemployment for that economy.\nIn the AD/AS diagram, cyclical unemployment is shown by how close the economy is to the potential or full employment level of GDP. Returning to [link], relatively low cyclical unemployment for an economy occurs when the level of output is close to potential GDP, as in the equilibrium point E1. Conversely, high cyclical unemployment arises when the output is substantially to the left of potential GDP on the AD/AS diagram, as at the equilibrium point E0. The factors that determine the natural rate of unemployment are not shown separately in the AD/AS model, although they are implicitly part of what determines potential GDP or full employment GDP in a given economy.\n\n\n11.5.3 Inflationary Pressures in the AD/AS Diagram\nInflation fluctuates in the short run. Higher inflation rates have typically occurred either during or just after economic booms: for example, the biggest spurts of inflation in the U.S. economy during the twentieth century followed the wartime booms of World War I and World War II. Conversely, rates of inflation generally decline during recessions. As an extreme example, inflation actually became negative—a situation called “deflation”—during the Great Depression.\nEven during the relatively short recession of 1991–1992, the rate of inflation declined from 5.4% in 1990 to 3.0% in 1992. During the relatively short recession of 2001, the rate of inflation declined from 3.4% in 2000 to 1.6% in 2002. During the deep recession of 2007–2009, the rate of inflation declined from 3.8% in 2008 to –0.4% in 2009. Some countries have experienced bouts of high inflation that lasted for years. In the U.S. economy since the mid–1980s, inflation does not seem to have had any long-term trend to be substantially higher or lower; instead, it has stayed in the range of 1–5% annually.\nThe AD/AS framework implies two ways that inflationary pressures may arise. One possible trigger is if aggregate demand continues to shift to the right when the economy is already at or near potential GDP and full employment, thus pushing the macroeconomic equilibrium into the steep portion of the AS curve. In Figure 11.8 (a), there is a shift of aggregate demand to the right; the new equilibrium E1 is clearly at a higher price level than the original equilibrium E0. In this situation, the aggregate demand in the economy has soared so high that firms in the economy are not capable of producing additional goods, because labor and physical capital are fully employed, and so additional increases in aggregate demand can only result in a rise in the price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.8: Panel (a): A shift in aggregate demand, from AD0 to AD1, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the original equilibrium. Panel (b): A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, will lead to a lower real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1), while the original equilibrium (E0) is at the lower price level (P0).(a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD0 to AD1, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the original equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, will lead to a lower real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1), while the original equilibrium (E0) is at the lower price level (P0).\n\n\n\nAn alternative source of inflationary pressures can occur due to a rise in input prices that affects many or most firms across the economy—perhaps an important input to production like oil or labor—and causes the aggregate supply curve to shift back to the left. In Figure 11.8 (b), the shift of the SRAS curve to the left also increases the price level from P0 at the original equilibrium (E0) to a higher price level of P1 at the new equilibrium (E1). In effect, the rise in input prices ends up, after the final output is produced and sold, being passed along in the form of a higher price level for outputs.\nThe AD/AS diagram shows only a one-time shift in the price level. It does not address the question of what would cause inflation either to vanish after a year, or to sustain itself for several years. There are two explanations for why inflation may persist over time. One way that continual inflationary price increases can occur is if the government continually attempts to stimulate aggregate demand in a way that keeps pushing the AD curve when it is already in the steep portion of the SRAS curve.\nA second possibility is that, if inflation has been occurring for several years, a certain level of inflation may come to be expected. For example, if consumers, workers, and businesses all expect prices and wages to rise by a certain amount, then these expected rises in the price level can become built into the annual increases of prices, wages, and interest rates of the economy. These two reasons are interrelated, because if a government fosters a macroeconomic environment with inflationary pressures, then people will grow to expect inflation. However, the AD/AS diagram does not show these patterns of ongoing or expected inflation in a direct way.\n\n\n11.5.4 Importance of the Aggregate Demand/Aggregate Supply Model\nMacroeconomics takes an overall view of the economy, which means that it needs to juggle many different concepts. For example, start with the three macroeconomic goals of growth, low inflation, and low unemployment. Aggregate demand has four elements: consumption, investment, government spending, and exports less imports.\nAggregate supply reveals how businesses throughout the economy will react to a higher price level for outputs. Finally, a wide array of economic events and policy decisions can affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply, including government tax and spending decisions; consumer and business confidence; changes in prices of key inputs like oil; and technology that brings higher levels of productivity.\nThe aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is one of the fundamental diagrams in this course because it provides an overall framework for bringing these factors together in one diagram. Indeed, some version of the AD/AS model will appear in every chapter in the rest of this book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nCyclical unemployment is relatively large in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is substantially below potential GDP.\nCyclical unemployment is small in the AD/AS framework when the equilibrium is near potential GDP.\nThe natural rate of unemployment, as determined by the labor market institutions of the economy, is built into what is meant by potential GDP, but does not otherwise appear in an AD/AS diagram.\nPressures for inflation to rise or fall are shown in the AD/AS framework when the movement from one equilibrium to another causes the price level to rise or to fall.\nThe balance of trade does not appear directly in the AD/AS diagram, but it appears indirectly in several ways. Increases in exports or declines in imports can cause shifts in AD. Changes in the price of key imported inputs to production, like oil, can cause shifts in AS.\nThe AD/AS model is the key model used in this book to understand macroeconomic issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat impact would a decrease in the size of the labor force have on GDP and the price level according to the AD/AS model?\nSuppose, after five years of sluggish growth, the economy of the European Union picks up speed. What would be the likely impact on the U.S. trade balance, GDP, and employment?\nSuppose the Federal Reserve begins to increase the supply of money at an increasing rate. What impact would that have on GDP, unemployment, and inflation?",

    "text": "11.6 Keynes’ Law and Say’s Law in the AD/AS Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nIdentify the neoclassical zone, the intermediate zone, and the Keynesian zone in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model\nUse an aggregate demand/aggregate supply model as a diagnostic test to understand the current state of the economy\n\n\n\nThe AD/AS model can be used to illustrate both Say’s law that supply creates its own demand and Keynes’ law that demand creates its own supply. Consider the three zones of the SRAS curve as identified in Figure: the Keynesian zone, the neoclassical zone, and the intermediate zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.9: Near the equilibrium Ek, in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will affect the output level Yk, but will not much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the quantity of output. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone at the far right of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater effect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP largely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left would decrease both the output level and the price level.\n\n\n\nFocus first on the Keynesian zone, that portion of the SRAS curve on the far left which is relatively flat. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ek, then certain statements about the economic situation will follow. In the Keynesian zone, the equilibrium level of real GDP is far below potential GDP, the economy is in recession, and cyclical unemployment is high. If aggregate demand shifted to the right or left in the Keynesian zone, it will determine the resulting level of output (and thus unemployment). However, inflationary price pressure is not much of a worry in the Keynesian zone, since the price level does not vary much in this zone.\nNow, focus your attention on the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve, which is the near-vertical portion on the right-hand side. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like En where output is at or near potential GDP, then the size of potential GDP pretty much determines the level of output in the economy. Since the equilibrium is near potential GDP, cyclical unemployment is low in this economy, although structural unemployment may remain an issue. In the neoclassical zone, shifts of aggregate demand to the right or the left have little effect on the level of output or employment. The only way to increase the size of the real GDP in the neoclassical zone is for AS to shift to the right. However, shifts in AD in the neoclassical zone will create pressures to change the price level.\nFinally, consider the intermediate zone of the SRAS curve in Figure 11.9. If the AD curve crosses this portion of the SRAS curve at an equilibrium point like Ei, then we might expect unemployment and inflation to move in opposing directions. For instance, a shift of AD to the right will move output closer to potential GDP and thus reduce unemployment, but will also lead to a higher price level and upward pressure on inflation. Conversely, a shift of AD to the left will move output further from potential GDP and raise unemployment, but will also lead to a lower price level and downward pressure on inflation.\nThis approach of dividing the SRAS curve into different zones works as a diagnostic test that can be applied to an economy, like a doctor checking a patient for symptoms. First, figure out what zone the economy is in and then the economic issues, tradeoffs, and policy choices will be clarified. Some economists believe that the economy is strongly predisposed to be in one zone or another. Thus, hard-line Keynesian economists believe that the economies are in the Keynesian zone most of the time, and so they view the neoclassical zone as a theoretical abstraction. Conversely, hard-line neoclassical economists argue that economies are in the neoclassical zone most of the time and that the Keynesian zone is a distraction. The Keynesian Perspective and The Neoclassical Perspective should help to clarify the underpinnings and consequences of these contrasting views of the macroeconomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFROM HOUSING BUBBLE TO HOUSING BUST\nEconomic fluctuations, whether those experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the stagflation of the 1970s, or the Great Recession of 2008–2009, can be explained using the AD/AS diagram. Short-run fluctuations in output occur due to shifts of the SRAS curve, the AD curve, or both. In the case of the housing bubble, rising home values caused the AD curve to shift to the right as more people felt that rising home values increased their overall wealth. Many homeowners took on mortgages that exceeded their ability to pay because, as home values continued to go up, the increased value would pay off any debt outstanding. Increased wealth due to rising home values lead to increased home equity loans and increased spending. All these activities pushed AD to the right, contributing to low unemployment rates and economic growth in the United States. When the housing bubble burst, overall wealth dropped dramatically, wiping out the recent gains. This drop in the value of homes was a demand shock to the U.S. economy because of its impact directly on the wealth of the household sector, and its contagion into the financial that essentially locked up new credit. The AD curve shifted to the left as evidenced by the rising unemployment of the Great Recession.\nUnderstanding the source of these macroeconomic fluctuations provided monetary and fiscal policy makers with insight about what policy actions to take to mitigate the impact of the housing crisis. From a monetary policy perspective, the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates to between 0% and 0.25 %, to loosen up credit throughout the financial system. Discretionary fiscal policy measures included the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that allowed for the purchase of troubled assets, such as mortgages, from financial institutions and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 that increased government spending on infrastructure, provided for tax cuts, and increased transfer payments. In combination, both monetary and fiscal policy measures were designed to help stimulate aggregate demand in the U.S. economy, pushing the AD curve to the right.\nWhile most economists agree on the usefulness of the AD/AS diagram in analyzing the sources of these fluctuations, there is still some disagreement about the effectiveness of policy decisions that are useful in stabilizing these fluctuations. We discuss the possible policy actions and the differences among economists about their effectiveness in more detail in The Keynesian Perspective, Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation, and Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe SRAS curve can be divided into three zones. Keynes’ law says demand creates its own supply, so that changes in aggregate demand cause changes in real GDP and employment. Keynes’ law can be shown on the horizontal Keynesian zone of the aggregate supply curve. The Keynesian zone occurs at the left of the SRAS curve where it is fairly flat, so movements in AD will affect output, but have little effect on the price level.\nSay’s law says supply creates its own demand.\nChanges in aggregate demand have no effect on real GDP and employment, only on the price level. Say’s law can be shown on the vertical neoclassical zone of the aggregate supply curve.\nThe neoclassical zone occurs at the right of the SRAS curve where it is fairly vertical, and so movements in AD will affect the price level, but have little impact on output. The intermediate zone in the middle of the SRAS curve is upward-sloping, so a rise in AD will cause higher output and price level, while a fall in AD will lead to a lower output and price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the economy is operating in the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve and aggregate demand falls, what is likely to happen to real GDP?\nIf the economy is operating in the Keynesian zone of the SRAS curve and aggregate demand falls, what is likely to happen to real GDP?\nWhat is the Keynesian zone of the SRAS curve? How much is the price level likely to change in the Keynesian zone?\nWhat is the neoclassical zone of the SRAS curve? How much is the output level likely to change in the neoclassical zone?\nWhat is the intermediate zone of the SRAS curve? Will a rise in output be accompanied by a rise or a fall in the price level in this zone?",

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the number of unemployed Americans rose from 6.8 million in May 2007 to 15.4 million in October 2009. During that time, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that approximately 170,000 small businesses closed. Mass layoffs peaked in February 2009 when employers gave 326,392 workers notice. U.S. productivity and output fell as well. Job losses, declining home values, declining incomes, and uncertainty about the future caused consumption expenditures to decrease. According to the BLS, household spending dropped by 7.8%.\nHome foreclosures and the meltdown in U.S. financial markets called for immediate action by Congress, the President, and the Federal Reserve Bank. For example, the government implemented programs such as the American Restoration and Recovery Act to help millions of people by providing tax credits for homebuyers, paying “cash for clunkers,” and extending unemployment benefits. From cutting back on spending, filing for unemployment, and losing homes, millions of people were affected by the recession. While the United States is now on the path to recovery, people will feel the impact for many years to come.\nWhat caused this recession and what prevented the economy from spiraling further into another depression? Policymakers looked to the lessons learned from the 1930s Great Depression and to John Maynard Keynes' models to analyze the causes and find solutions to the country’s economic woes. The Keynesian perspective is the subject of this chapter.\n\n\nThe Keynesian perspective focuses on aggregate demand. The idea is simple: firms produce output only if they expect it to sell. Thus, while the availability of the factors of production determines a nation’s potential GDP, the amount of goods and services that actually sell, known as real GDP, depends on how much demand exists across the economy. Figure 11.10 illustrates this point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.10: The Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.\n\n\n\nKeynes argued that, for reasons we explain shortly, aggregate demand is not stable—that it can change unexpectedly. Suppose the economy starts where AD intersects SRAS at P0 and Yp. Because Yp is potential output, the economy is at full employment. Because AD is volatile, it can easily fall. Thus, even if we start at Yp, if AD falls, then we find ourselves in what Keynes termed a recessionary gap. The economy is in equilibrium but with less than full employment, as Y1 in Figure shows. Keynes believed that the economy would tend to stay in a recessionary gap, with its attendant unemployment, for a significant period of time.\nIn the same way (although we do not show it in the figure), if AD increases, the economy could experience an inflationary gap, where demand is attempting to push the economy past potential output. Consequently, the economy experiences inflation. The key policy implication for either situation is that government needs to step in and close the gap, increasing spending during recessions and decreasing spending during booms to return aggregate demand to match potential output.\nRecall from The Aggregate Supply-Aggregate Demand Model that aggregate demand is total spending, economy-wide, on domestic goods and services. (Aggregate demand (AD) is actually what economists call total planned expenditure. Read the appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model for more on this.) You may also remember that aggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption expenditure, investment expenditure, government spending, and spending on net exports (exports minus imports). In the following sections, we will examine each component through the Keynesian perspective.\n\n11.7.1 What Determines Consumption Expenditure?\nConsumption expenditure is spending by households and individuals on durable goods, nondurable goods, and services. Durable goods are items that last and provide value over time, such as automobiles. Nondurable goods are things like groceries—once you consume them, they are gone. Recall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that services are intangible things consumers buy, like healthcare or entertainment.\nKeynes identified three factors that affect consumption:\n\n\nDisposable income: For most people, the single most powerful determinant of how much they consume is how much income they have in their take-home pay, also known as disposable income, which is income after taxes.\nExpected future income: Consumer expectations about future income also are important in determining consumption. If consumers feel optimistic about the future, they are more likely to spend and increase overall aggregate demand. News of recession and troubles in the economy will make them pull back on consumption.\nWealth or credit: When households experience a rise in wealth, they may be willing to consume a higher share of their income and to save less. When the U.S. stock market rose dramatically in the late 1990s, for example, U.S. savings rates declined, probably in part because people felt that their wealth had increased and there was less need to save. How do people spend beyond their income, when they perceive their wealth increasing? The answer is borrowing. On the other side, when the U.S. stock market declined about 40% from March 2008 to March 2009, people felt far greater uncertainty about their economic future, so savings rates increased while consumption declined.\n\n\nFinally, Keynes noted that a variety of other factors combine to determine how much people save and spend. If household preferences about saving shift in a way that encourages consumption rather than saving, then AD will shift out to the right.\n\n\n11.7.2 What Determines Investment Expenditure?\nWe call spending on new capital goods investment expenditure. Investment falls into four categories: producer’s durable equipment and software, nonresidential structures (such as factories, offices, and retail locations), changes in inventories, and residential structures (such as single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment buildings). Businesses conduct the first three types of investment, while households conduct the last.\nKeynes’s treatment of investment focuses on the key role of expectations about the future in influencing business decisions. When a business decides to make an investment in physical assets, like plants or equipment, or in intangible assets, like skills or a research and development project, that firm considers both the expected investment benefits (future profit expectations) and the investment costs (interest rates).\n\n\nExpectations of future profits: The clearest driver of investment benefits is expectations for future profits. When we expect an economy to grow, businesses perceive a growing market for their products. Their higher degree of business confidence will encourage new investment. For example, in the second half of the 1990s, U.S. investment levels surged from 18% of GDP in 1994 to 21% in 2000. However, when a recession started in 2001, U.S. investment levels quickly sank back to 18% of GDP by 2002.\nInterest rates also play a significant role in determining how much investment a firm will make. Just as individuals need to borrow money to purchase homes, so businesses need financing when they purchase big ticket items. The cost of investment thus includes the interest rate. Even if the firm has the funds, the interest rate measures the opportunity cost of purchasing business capital. Lower interest rates stimulate investment spending and higher interest rates reduce it.\n\n\nMany factors can affect the expected profitability on investment. For example, if the energy prices decline, then investments that use energy as an input will yield higher profits. If government offers special incentives for investment (for example, through the tax code), then investment will look more attractive; conversely, if government removes special investment incentives from the tax code, or increases other business taxes, then investment will look less attractive. As Keynes noted, business investment is the most variable of all the components of aggregate demand.\n\n\n11.7.3 What Determines Government Spending?\nThe third component of aggregate demand is federal, state, and local government spending. Although we usually view the United States as a market economy, government still plays a significant role in the economy. As we discuss in Environmental Protection and Negative Externalities and Positive Externalitites and Public Goods, government provides important public services such as national defense, transportation infrastructure, and education.\nKeynes recognized that the government budget offered a powerful tool for influencing aggregate demand. Not only could more government spending stimulate AD (or less government spending reduce it), but lowering or raising tax rates could influence consumption and investment spending. Keynes concluded that during extreme times like deep recessions, only the government had the power and resources to move aggregate demand.\n\n\n11.7.4 What Determines Net Exports?\nRecall that exports are domestically produced products that sell abroad while imports are foreign produced products that consumers purchase domestically. Since we define aggregate demand as spending on domestic goods and services, export expenditures add to AD, while import expenditures subtract from AD.\nTwo sets of factors can cause shifts in export and import demand: changes in relative growth rates between countries and changes in relative prices between countries. What is happening in the countries' economies that would be purchasing those exports heavily affects the level of demand for a nation's exports. For example, if major importers of American-made products like Canada, Japan, and Germany have recessions, exports of U.S. products to those countries are likely to decline. Conversely, the amount of income in the domestic economy directly affects the quantity of a nation's imports: more income will bring a higher level of imports.\nRelative prices of goods in domestic and international markets can also affect exports and imports. If U.S. goods are relatively cheaper compared with goods made in other places, perhaps because a group of U.S. producers has mastered certain productivity breakthroughs, then U.S. exports are likely to rise. If U.S. goods become relatively more expensive, perhaps because a change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and other currencies has pushed up the price of inputs to production in the United States, then exports from U.S. producers are likely to decline.\nTable 11.1 summarizes the reasons we have explained for changes in aggregate demand.\n\n\n\nTable 11.1: Determinants of Aggregate Demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReasons for a Decrease in Aggregate Demand\nReasons for an Increase in Aggregate Demand\n\n\n\n\n\nConsumption\n\n\nRise in taxes\nFall in income\nRise in interest rates\nDesire to save more\nDecrease in wealth\nFall in future expected income\n\n\n\n\nConsumption\n\n\nDecrease in taxes\nIncrease in income\nFall in interest rates\nDesire to save less\nRise in wealth\nRise in future expected income\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment\n\n\nFall in expected rate of return\nRise in interest rates\nDrop in business confidence\n\n\n\n\nInvestment\n\n\nRise in expected rate of return\nDrop in interest rates\nRise in business confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\nReduction in government spending\nIncrease in taxes\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\nIncrease in government spending\nDecrease in taxes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet Exports\n\n\nDecrease in foreign demand\nRelative price increase of U.S. goods\n\n\n\n\nNet Exports\n\n\nIncrease in foreign demand\nRelative price drop of U.S. goods\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nAggregate demand is the sum of four components: consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports.\nConsumption will change for a number of reasons, including movements in income, taxes, expectations about future income, and changes in wealth levels.\nInvestment will change in response to its expected profitability, which in turn is shaped by expectations about future economic growth, the creation of new technologies, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment.\nInvestment will also change when interest rates rise or fall.\nPolitical considerations determine government spending and taxes.\nExports and imports change according to relative growth rates and prices between two economies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Keynesian framework, which of the following events might cause a recession?

    "text": "11.8 The Building Blocks of Keynesian Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate the Keynesian view of recessions through an understanding of sticky wages and prices and the importance of aggregate demand\nExplain the coordination argument, menu costs, and macroeconomic externality\nAnalyze the impact of the expenditure multiplier\n\n\n\nNow that we have a clear understanding of what constitutes aggregate demand, we return to the Keynesian argument using the model of aggregate demand/aggregate supply (AD/AS). (For a similar treatment using Keynes’ income-expenditure model, see the appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model.)\nKeynesian economics focuses on explaining why recessions and depressions occur and offering a policy prescription for minimizing their effects. The Keynesian view of recession is based on two key building blocks. First, aggregate demand is not always automatically high enough to provide firms with an incentive to hire enough workers to reach full employment. Second, the macroeconomy may adjust only slowly to shifts in aggregate demand because of sticky wages and prices, which are wages and prices that do not respond to decreases or increases in demand. We will consider these two claims in turn, and then see how they are represented in the AD/AS model.\nThe first building block of the Keynesian diagnosis is that recessions occur when the level of demand for goods and services is less than what is produced when labor is fully employed. In other words, the intersection of aggregate supply and aggregate demand occurs at a level of output less than the level of GDP consistent with full employment. Suppose the stock market crashes, as in 1929, or suppose the housing market collapses, as in 2008. In either case, household wealth will decline, and consumption expenditure will follow. Suppose businesses see that consumer spending is falling. That will reduce expectations of the profitability of investment, so businesses will decrease investment expenditure.\nThis seemed to be the case during the Great Depression, since the physical capacity of the economy to supply goods did not alter much. No flood or earthquake or other natural disaster ruined factories in 1929 or 1930. No outbreak of disease decimated the ranks of workers. No key input price, like the price of oil, soared on world markets. The U.S. economy in 1933 had just about the same factories, workers, and state of technology as it had had four years earlier in 1929—and yet the economy had shrunk dramatically. This also seems to be what happened in 2008.\nAs Keynes recognized, the events of the Depression contradicted Say’s law that “supply creates its own demand.” Although production capacity existed, the markets were not able to sell their products. As a result, real GDP was less than potential GDP.\n\n11.8.1 Wage and Price Stickiness\nKeynes also pointed out that although AD fluctuated, prices and wages did not immediately respond as economists often expected. Instead, prices and wages are “sticky,” making it difficult to restore the economy to full employment and potential GDP. Keynes emphasized one particular reason why wages were sticky: the coordination argument. This argument points out that, even if most people would be willing—at least hypothetically—to see a decline in their own wages in bad economic times as long as everyone else also experienced such a decline, a market-oriented economy has no obvious way to implement a plan of coordinated wage reductions. Unemployment proposed a number of reasons why wages might be sticky downward, most of which center on the argument that businesses avoid wage cuts because they may in one way or another depress morale and hurt the productivity of the existing workers.\nSome modern economists have argued in a Keynesian spirit that, along with wages, other prices may be sticky, too. Many firms do not change their prices every day or even every month. When a firm considers changing prices, it must consider two sets of costs. First, changing prices uses company resources: managers must analyze the competition and market demand and decide the new prices, they must update sales materials, change billing records, and redo product and price labels. Second, frequent price changes may leave customers confused or angry—especially if they discover that a product now costs more than they expected. These costs of changing prices are called menu costs—like the costs of printing a new set of menus with different prices in a restaurant. Prices do respond to forces of supply and demand, but from a macroeconomic perspective, the process of changing all prices throughout the economy takes time.\nTo understand the effect of sticky wages and prices in the economy, consider Figure 11.11 (a) illustrating the overall labor market, while Figure 11.11 (b) illustrates a market for a specific good or service. The original equilibrium (E0) in each market occurs at the intersection of the demand curve (D0) and supply curve (S0). When aggregate demand declines, the demand for labor shifts to the left (to D1) in Figure 11.11 (a) and the demand for goods shifts to the left (to D1) in Figure 11.11 (b). However, because of sticky wages and prices, the wage remains at its original level (W0) for a period of time and the price remains at its original level (P0).\nAs a result, a situation of excess supply—where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the existing wage or price—exists in markets for both labor and goods, and Q1 is less than Q0 in both Figure 11.11 (a) and Figure 11.11 (b). When many labor markets and many goods markets all across the economy find themselves in this position, the economy is in a recession; that is, firms cannot sell what they wish to produce at the existing market price and do not wish to hire all who are willing to work at the existing market wage. The Clear It Up feature discusses this problem in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.11: In both (a) and (b), demand shifts left from D0 to D1. However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately decline. In (a), the quantity demanded of labor at the original wage (W0) is Q0, but with the new demand curve for labor (D1), it will be Q1. Similarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the original price (P0) is Q0, but at the new demand curve (D1) it will be Q1. An excess supply of labor will exist, which we call unemployment. An excess supply of goods will also exist, where the quantity demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus, sticky wages and sticky prices, combined with a drop in demand, bring about unemployment and recession. The Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHY IS THE PACE OF WAGE ADJUSTMENTS SLOW?\nThe recovery after the Great Recession in the United States has been slow, with wages stagnant, if not declining. In fact, many low-wage workers at McDonalds, Dominos, and Walmart have threatened to strike for higher wages. Their plight is part of a larger trend in job growth and pay in the post–recession recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.12: Jobs lost/gained\n\n\n\nThe National Employment Law Project compiled data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that, during the Great Recession, 60% of job losses were in medium-wage occupations. Most of them were replaced during the recovery period with lower-wage jobs in the service, retail, and food industries. Figure 11.12 illustrates this data.\nWages in the service, retail, and food industries are at or near minimum wage and tend to be both downwardly and upwardly “sticky.” Wages are downwardly sticky due to minimum wage laws. They may be upwardly sticky if insufficient competition in low-skilled labor markets enables employers to avoid raising wages that would reduce their profits. At the same time, however, the Consumer Price Index increased 11% between 2007 and 2012, pushing real wages down.\n\n\n\n\n11.8.2 The Two Keynesian Assumptions in the AD/AS Model\nFigure 11.13 is the AD/AS diagram which illustrates these two Keynesian assumptions—the importance of aggregate demand in causing recession and the stickiness of wages and prices. Note that because of the stickiness of wages and prices, the aggregate supply curve is flatter than either supply curve (labor or specific good). In fact, if wages and prices were so sticky that they did not fall at all, the aggregate supply curve would be completely flat below potential GDP, as Figure shows. This outcome is an important example of a macroeconomic externality, where what happens at the macro level is different from and inferior to what happens at the micro level. For example, a firm should respond to a decrease in demand for its product by cutting its price to increase sales. However, if all firms experience a decrease in demand for their products, sticky prices in the aggregate prevent aggregate demand from rebounding (which we would show as a movement along the AD curve in response to a lower price level).\nThe original equilibrium of this economy occurs where the aggregate demand function (AD0) intersects with AS. Since this intersection occurs at potential GDP (Yp), the economy is operating at full employment. When aggregate demand shifts to the left, all the adjustment occurs through decreased real GDP. There is no decrease in the price level. Since the equilibrium occurs at Y1, the economy experiences substantial unemployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.13: This figure illustrates the two key assumptions behind Keynesian economics. A recession begins when aggregate demand declines from AD0 to AD1. The recession persists because of the assumption of fixed wages and prices, which makes the SRAS flat below potential GDP. If that were not the case, the price level would fall also, raising GDP and limiting the recession. Instead the intersection E1 occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is less than potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.8.3 The Expenditure Multiplier\nA key concept in Keynesian economics is the expenditure multiplier. The expenditure multiplier is the idea that not only does spending affect the equilibrium level of GDP, but that spending is powerful. More precisely, it means that a change in spending causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.\n\\[\\frac{\\Delta Y}{\\Delta Spending} &gt; 1\\]\nThe reason for the expenditure multiplier is that one person’s spending becomes another person’s income, which leads to additional spending and additional income so that the cumulative impact on GDP is larger than the initial increase in spending. The appendix on The Expenditure-Output Model provides the details of the multiplier process, but the concept is important enough for us to summarize here. While the multiplier is important for understanding the effectiveness of fiscal policy, it occurs whenever any autonomous increase in spending occurs. Additionally, the multiplier operates in a negative as well as a positive direction. Thus, when investment spending collapsed during the Great Depression, it caused a much larger decrease in real GDP. The size of the multiplier is critical and was a key element in discussions of the effectiveness of the Obama administration’s fiscal stimulus package, officially titled the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nKeynesian economics is based on two main ideas: (1) aggregate demand is more likely than aggregate supply to be the primary cause of a short-run economic event like a recession; (2) wages and prices can be sticky, and so, in an economic downturn, unemployment can result.\nThe latter is an example of a macroeconomic externality.\nWhile surpluses cause prices to fall at the micro level, they do not necessarily at the macro level.\nInstead the adjustment to a decrease in demand occurs only through decreased quantities.\nOne reason why prices may be sticky is menu costs, the costs of changing prices.\nThese include internal costs a business faces in changing prices in terms of labeling, recordkeeping, and accounting, and also the costs of communicating the price change to (possibly unhappy) customers.\nKeynesians also believe in the existence of the expenditure multiplier—the notion that a change in autonomous expenditure causes a more than proportionate change in GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom a Keynesian point of view, which is more likely to cause a recession: aggregate demand or aggregate supply, and why?\nWhy do sticky wages and prices increase the impact of an economic downturn on unemployment and recession?\nExplain what economists mean by “menu costs.”",

In the aftermath of the human devastation and misery of the Great Depression, many people—including many economists—became more aware of vulnerabilities within the market-oriented economic system. Some supporters of Keynesian economics advocated a high degree of government planning in all parts of the economy.\nHowever, Keynes himself was careful to separate the issue of aggregate demand from the issue of how well individual markets worked. He argued that individual markets for goods and services were appropriate and useful, but that sometimes that level of aggregate demand was just too low. When 10 million people are willing and able to work, but one million of them are unemployed, he argued, individual markets may be doing a perfectly good job of allocating the efforts of the nine million workers—the problem is that insufficient aggregate demand exists to support jobs for all 10 million. Thus, he believed that, while government should ensure that overall level of aggregate demand is sufficient for an economy to reach full employment, this task did not imply that the government should attempt to set prices and wages throughout the economy, nor to take over and manage large corporations or entire industries directly.\nEven if one accepts the Keynesian economic theory, a number of practical questions remain. In the real world, can government economists identify potential GDP accurately? Is a desired increase in aggregate demand better accomplished by a tax cut or by an increase in government spending? Given the inevitable delays and uncertainties as governments enact policies into law, is it reasonable to expect that the government can implement Keynesian economics? Can fixing a recession really be just as simple as pumping up aggregate demand? Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy will probe these issues. The Keynesian approach, with its focus on aggregate demand and sticky prices, has proved useful in understanding how the economy fluctuates in the short run and why recessions and cyclical unemployment occur. In The Neoclassical Perspective, we will consider some of the shortcomings of the Keynesian approach and why it is not especially well-suited for long-run macroeconomic analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT RECESSION\nThe lessons learned during the 1930s Great Depression and the aggregate expenditure model that John Maynard Keynes proposed gave the modern economists and policymakers of today the tools to effectively navigate the treacherous economy in the latter half of the 2000s. In “How the Great Recession Was Brought to an End\", Alan S. Blinder and Mark Zandi wrote that the actions taken by today’s policymakers stand in sharp contrast to those of the early years of the Great Depression.\nToday’s economists and policymakers were not content to let the markets recover from recession without taking proactive measures to support consumption and investment. The Federal Reserve actively lowered short-term interest rates and developed innovative ways to pump money into the economy so that credit and investment would not dry up. Both Presidents Bush and Obama and Congress implemented a variety of programs ranging from tax rebates to “Cash for Clunkers” to the Troubled Asset Relief Program to stimulate and stabilize household consumption and encourage investment.\nAlthough these policies came under harsh criticism from the public and many politicians, they lessened the impact of the economic downturn and may have saved the country from a second Great Depression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe Keynesian prescription for stabilizing the economy implies government intervention at the macroeconomic level—increasing aggregate demand when private demand falls and decreasing aggregate demand when private demand rises.\nThis does not imply that the government should be passing laws or regulations that set prices and quantities in microeconomic markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes Keynesian economics require government to set controls on prices, wages, or interest rates?\nList three practical problems with the Keynesian perspective.\nHow did the Keynesian perspective address the economic market failure of the Great Depression?",

    "text": "11.10 The Neoclassical Perspective\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nNeoclassical Perspective\n\n\n\nThe Great Recession ended in June 2009 after 18 months, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). The NBER examines a variety of measures of economic activity to gauge the economy's overall health. These measures include real income, wholesale and retail sales, employment, and industrial production. In the years since the official end of this historic economic downturn, it has become clear that the Great Recession was two-pronged, hitting the U.S. economy with the collapse of the housing market and the failure of the financial system's credit institutions, further contaminating global economies. While the stock market rapidly lost trillions of dollars of value, consumer spending dried up, and companies began cutting jobs, economic policymakers were struggling with how to best combat and prevent a national, and even global economic collapse. In the end, policymakers used a number of controversial monetary and fiscal policies to support the housing market and domestic industries as well as to stabilize the financial sector. Some of these initiatives included:\nFederal Reserve Bank purchase of both traditional and nontraditional assets off banks' balance sheets. By doing this, the Fed injected money into the banking system and increased the amounts of funds available to lend to the business sector and consumers. This also dropped short-term interest rates to as low as zero percent, which had the effect of devaluing U.S. dollars in the global market and boosting exports.\nThe Congress and the President also passed several pieces of legislation that would stabilize the financial market. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), passed in late 2008, allowed the government to inject cash into troubled banks and other financial institutions and help support General Motors and Chrysler as they faced bankruptcy and threatened job losses throughout their supply chain. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in early 2009 provided tax rebates to low- and middle-income households to encourage consumer spending.\nFour years after the end of the Great Recession, the economy has yet to return to its pre-recession levels of productivity and growth. Annual productivity increased only 1.9% between 2009 and 2012 compared to its 2.7% annual growth rate between 2000 and 2007, unemployment remains above the natural rate, and real GDP continues to lag behind potential growth. The actions the government has taken to stabilize the economy are still under scrutiny and debate about their effectiveness continues. In this chapter, we will discuss the neoclassical perspective on economics and compare it to the Keynesian perspective. At the end of the chapter, we will use the neoclassical perspective to analyze the actions the government has taken in the Great Recession.\nIn Chicago, Illinois, the highest recorded temperature was 105° in July 1995, while the lowest recorded temperature was 27° below zero in January 1958. Understanding why these extreme weather patterns occurred would be interesting. However, if you wanted to understand the typical weather pattern in Chicago, instead of focusing on one-time extremes, you would need to look at the entire pattern of data over time.\nA similar lesson applies to the study of macroeconomics. It is interesting to study extreme situations, like the 1930s Great Depression or what many have called the 2008-2009 Great Recession. If you want to understand the whole picture, however, you need to look at the long term. Consider the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate has fluctuated from as low as 3.5% in 1969 to as high as 9.7% in 1982 and 9.6% in 2009. Even as the U.S. unemployment rate rose during recessions and declined during expansions, it kept returning to the general neighborhood of 5.0–5.5%. When the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office carried out its long-range economic forecasts in 2010, it assumed that from 2015 to 2020, after the recession has passed, the unemployment rate would be 5.0%. From a long-run perspective, the economy seems to keep adjusting back to this rate of unemployment.\nAs the name “neoclassical” implies, this perspective of how the macroeconomy works is a “new” view of the “old” classical model of the economy. The classical view, the predominant economic philosophy until the Great Depression, was that short-term fluctuations in economic activity would rather quickly, with flexible prices, adjust back to full employment. This view of the economy implied a vertical aggregate supply curve at full employment GDP, and prescribed a “hands off” policy approach. For example, if the economy were to slip into recession (a leftward shift of the aggregate demand curve), it would temporarily exhibit a surplus of goods. Falling prices would eliminate this surplus, and the economy would return to full employment level of GDP. No active fiscal or monetary policy was needed. In fact, the classical view was that expansionary fiscal or monetary policy would only cause inflation, rather than increase GDP. The deep and lasting impact of the Great Depression changed this thinking and Keynesian economics, which prescribed active fiscal policy to alleviate weak aggregate demand, became the more mainstream perspective.",

This chapter begins with two building blocks of neoclassical economics: (1) potential GDP determines the economy's the size and (2) wages and prices will adjust in a flexible manner so that the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe key policy implication is this:\nThe government should focus more on long-term growth and on controlling inflation than on worrying about recession or cyclical unemployment. This focus on long-run growth rather than the short-run fluctuations in the business cycle means that neoclassical economics is more useful for long-run macroeconomic analysis and Keynesian economics is more useful for analyzing the macroeconomic short run. Let's consider the two neoclassical building blocks in turn, and how we can embody them in the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model.\n\n\n\n11.11.1 The Importance of Potential GDP in the Long Run\nOver the long run, the level of potential GDP determines the size of real GDP. When economists refer to “potential GDP” they are referring to that level of output that an economy can achieve when all resources (land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability) are fully employed. While the unemployment rate in labor markets will never be zero, full employment in the labor market refers to zero cyclical unemployment. There will still be some level of unemployment due to frictional or structural unemployment, but when the economy is operating with zero cyclical unemployment, economists say that the economy is at the natural rate of unemployment or at full employment.\nEconomists benchmark actual or real GDP against the potential GDP to determine how well the economy is performing. As explained in Economic Growth, we can explain GDP growth by increases and investment in physical capital and human capital per person as well as advances in technology. Physical capital per person refers to the amount and kind of machinery and equipment available to help people get work done. Compare, for example, your productivity in typing a term paper on a typewriter to working on your laptop with word processing software. Clearly, you will be able to be more productive using word processing software. The technology and level of capital of your laptop and software has increased your productivity. More broadly, the development of GPS technology and Universal Product Codes (those barcodes on every product we buy) has made it much easier for firms to track shipments, tabulate inventories, and sell and distribute products. These two technological innovations, and many others, have increased a nation's ability to produce goods and services for a given population. Likewise, increasing human capital involves increasing levels of knowledge, education, and skill sets per person through vocational or higher education. Physical and human capital improvements with technological advances will increase overall productivity and, thus, GDP.\nTo see how these improvements have increased productivity and output at the national level, we should examine evidence from the United States. The United States experienced significant growth in the twentieth century due to phenomenal changes in infrastructure, equipment, and technological improvements in physical capital and human capital. The population more than tripled in the twentieth century, from 76 million in 1900 to over 300 million in 2016. The human capital of modern workers is far higher today because the education and skills of workers have risen dramatically. In 1900, only about one-eighth of the U.S. population had completed high school and just one person in 40 had completed a four-year college degree. By 2010, more than 87% of Americans had a high school degree and over 29% had a four-year college degree as well. In 2014, 40% of working-age Americans had a four-year college degree. The average amount of physical capital per worker has grown dramatically. The technology available to modern workers is extraordinarily better than a century ago: cars, airplanes, electrical machinery, smartphones, computers, chemical and biological advances, materials science, health care—the list of technological advances could run on and on. More workers, higher skill levels, larger amounts of physical capital per worker, and amazingly better technology, and potential GDP for the U.S. economy has clearly increased a great deal since 1900.\nThis growth has fallen below its potential GDP and, at times, has exceeded its potential. For example from 2008 to 2009, the U.S. economy tumbled into recession and remains below its potential. At other times, like in the late 1990s, the economy ran at potential GDP—or even slightly ahead.\nFigure 11.14 shows the actual data for the increase in real GDP since 1960. The slightly smoother line shows the potential GDP since 1960 as estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Most economic recessions and upswings are times when the economy is 1–3 percent below or above potential GDP in a given year. Clearly, short-run fluctuations around potential GDP do exist, but over the long run, the upward trend of potential GDP determines the size of the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.14: Actual GDP falls below potential GDP during and after recessions, like the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82, 1990–91, 2001, and 2008–2009 and continues below potential GDP through 2016. In other cases, actual GDP can be above potential GDP for a time, as in the late 1990s.\n\n\n\nIn the aggregate demand/aggregate supply model, we show potential GDP as a vertical line. Neoclassical economists who focus on potential GDP as the primary determinant of real GDP argue that the long-run aggregate supply curve is located at potential GDP—that is, we draw the long-run aggregate supply curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as Figure 11.15 shows. A vertical LRAS curve means that the level of aggregate supply (or potential GDP) will determine the economy's real GDP, regardless of the level of aggregate demand. Over time, increases in the quantity and quality of physical capital, increases in human capital, and technological advancements shift potential GDP and the vertical LRAS curve gradually to the right. Economists often describe this gradual increase in an economy's potential GDP as a nation's long-term economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.15: In the neoclassical model, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP. If AS is vertical, then it determines the level of real output, no matter where we draw the aggregate demand curve. Over time, the LRAS curve shifts to the right as productivity increases and potential GDP expands.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.11.2 The Role of Flexible Prices\nHow does the macroeconomy adjust back to its level of potential GDP in the long run? What if aggregate demand increases or decreases? Economists base the neoclassical view of how the macroeconomy adjusts on the insight that even if wages and prices are “sticky”, or slow to change, in the short run, they are flexible over time. To understand this better, let's follow the connections from the short-run to the long-run macroeconomic equilibrium.\nThe aggregate demand and aggregate supply diagram in Figure 11.16 shows two aggregate supply curves. We draw the original upward sloping aggregate supply curve (SRAS0) is a short-run or Keynesian AS curve. The vertical aggregate supply curve (LRASn) is the long-run or neoclassical AS curve, which is located at potential GDP. The original aggregate demand curve, labeled AD0, so that the original equilibrium occurs at point E0, at which point the economy is producing at its potential GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.16: The original equilibrium (E0), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts right from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is E1, with a higher output level of 550 and an increase in the price level to 125. With unemployment rates unsustainably low, eager employers bid up wages, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a higher price level of 130. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, determines the level of real GDP in this economy in the long run.\n\n\n\nNow, imagine that some economic event boosts aggregate demand: perhaps a surge of export sales or a rise in business confidence that leads to more investment, perhaps a policy decision like higher government spending, or perhaps a tax cut that leads to additional aggregate demand. The short-run Keynesian analysis is that the rise in aggregate demand will shift the aggregate demand curve out to the right, from AD0 to AD1, leading to a new equilibrium at point E1 with higher output, lower unemployment, and pressure for an inflationary rise in the price level.\nIn the long-run neoclassical analysis, however, the chain of economic events is just beginning. As economic output rises above potential GDP, the level of unemployment falls. The economy is now above full employment and there is a labor shortage. Eager employers are trying to bid workers away from other companies and to encourage their current workers to exert more effort and to work longer hours. This high demand for labor will drive up wages. Most employers review their workers salaries only once or twice a year, and so it will take time before the higher wages filter through the economy. As wages do rise, it will mean a leftward shift in the short-run Keynesian aggregate supply curve back to SRAS1, because the price of a major input to production has increased. The economy moves to a new equilibrium (E2). The new equilibrium has the same level of real GDP as did the original equilibrium (E0), but there has been an inflationary increase in the price level.\nThis description of the short-run shift from E0 to E1 and the long-run shift from E1 to E2 is a step-by-step way of making a simple point: the economy cannot sustain production above its potential GDP in the long run. An economy may produce above its level of potential GDP in the short run, under pressure from a surge in aggregate demand. Over the long run, however, that surge in aggregate demand ends up as an increase in the price level, not as a rise in output.\nThe rebound of the economy back to potential GDP also works in response to a shift to the left in aggregate demand. Figure 11.17 again starts with two aggregate supply curves, with SRAS0 showing the original upward sloping short-run Keynesian AS curve and LRASn showing the vertical long-run neoclassical aggregate supply curve. A decrease in aggregate demand—for example, because of a decline in consumer confidence that leads to less consumption and more saving—causes the original aggregate demand curve AD0 to shift back to AD1. The shift from the original equilibrium (E0) to the new equilibrium (E1) results in a decline in output. The economy is now below full employment and there is a surplus of labor. As output falls below potential GDP, unemployment rises. While a lower price level (i.e., deflation) is rare in the United States, it does happen occasionally during very weak periods of economic activity. For practical purposes, we might consider a lower price level in the AD–AS model as indicative of disinflation, which is a decline in the inflation rate. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve LRASn, which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, ultimately determines this economy's real GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.17: The original equilibrium (E0), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts left, from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is at E1, with a lower output level of 450 and downward pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates, wages are held down. Lower wages are an economy-wide decrease in the price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a lower price level of 110.\n\n\n\nAgain, from the neoclassical perspective, this short-run scenario is only the beginning of the chain of events. The higher level of unemployment means more workers looking for jobs. As a result, employers can hold down on pay increases—or perhaps even replace some of their higher-paid workers with unemployed people willing to accept a lower wage. As wages stagnate or fall, this decline in the price of a key input means that the short-run Keynesian aggregate supply curve shifts to the right from its original (SRAS0 to SRAS1). The overall impact in the long run, as the macroeconomic equilibrium shifts from E0 to E1 to E2, is that the level of output returns to potential GDP, where it started. There is, however, downward pressure on the price level. Thus, in the neoclassical view, changes in aggregate demand can have a short-run impact on output and on unemployment—but only a short-run impact. In the long run, when wages and prices are flexible, potential GDP and aggregate supply determine real GDP's size.\n\n\n11.11.3 How Fast Is the Speed of Macroeconomic Adjustment?\nHow long does it take for wages and prices to adjust, and for the economy to rebound to its potential GDP? This subject is highly contentious. Keynesian economists argue that if the adjustment from recession to potential GDP takes a very long time, then neoclassical theory may be more hypothetical than practical. In response to John Maynard Keynes' immortal words, “In the long run we are all dead,” neoclassical economists respond that even if the adjustment takes as long as, say, ten years the neoclassical perspective remains of central importance in understanding the economy.\nOne subset of neoclassical economists holds that wage and price adjustment in the macroeconomy might be quite rapid. The theory of rational expectations holds that people form the most accurate possible expectations about the future that they can, using all information available to them. In an economy where most people have rational expectations, economic adjustments may happen very quickly.\nTo understand how rational expectations may affect the speed of price adjustments, think about a situation in the real estate market. Imagine that several events seem likely to push up home values in the neighborhood. Perhaps a local employer announces that it plans to hire many more people or the city announces that it will build a local park or a library in that neighborhood. The theory of rational expectations points out that even though none of the changes will happen immediately, home prices in the neighborhood will rise immediately, because the expectation that homes will be worth more in the future will lead buyers to be willing to pay more in the present. The amount of the immediate increase in home prices will depend on how likely it seems that the announcements about the future will actually happen and on how distant the local jobs and neighborhood improvements are in the future. The key point is that, because of rational expectations, prices do not wait on events, but adjust immediately.\nAt a macroeconomic level, the theory of rational expectations points out that if the aggregate supply curve is vertical over time, then people should rationally expect this pattern. When a shift in aggregate demand occurs, people and businesses with rational expectations will know that its impact on output and employment will be temporary, while its impact on the price level will be permanent. If firms and workers perceive the outcome of the process in advance, and if all firms and workers know that everyone else is perceiving the process in the same way, then they have no incentive to go through an extended series of short-run scenarios, like a firm first hiring more people when aggregate demand shifts out and then firing those same people when aggregate supply shifts back. Instead, everyone will recognize where this process is heading—toward a change in the price level—and then will act on that expectation. In this scenario, the expected long-run change in the price level may happen very quickly, without a drawn-out zigzag of output and employment first moving one way and then the other.\nThe theory that people and firms have rational expectations can be a useful simplification, but as a statement about how people and businesses actually behave, the assumption seems too strong. After all, many people and firms are not especially well informed, either about what is happening in the economy or about how the economy works. An alternate assumption is that people and firms act with adaptive expectations: they look at past experience and gradually adapt their beliefs and behavior as circumstances change, but are not perfect synthesizers of information and accurate predictors of the future in the sense of rational expectations theory. If most people and businesses have some form of adaptive expectations, then the adjustment from the short run and long run will be traced out in incremental steps that occur over time.\nThe empirical evidence on the speed of macroeconomic adjustment of prices and wages is not clear-cut. The speed of macroeconomic adjustment probably varies among different countries and time periods. A reasonable guess is that the initial short-run effect of a shift in aggregate demand might last two to five years, before the adjustments in wages and prices cause the economy to adjust back to potential GDP. Thus, one might think of the short run for applying Keynesian analysis as time periods less than two to five years, and the long run for applying neoclassical analysis as longer than five years. For practical purposes, this guideline is frustratingly imprecise, but when analyzing a complex social mechanism like an economy as it evolves over time, some imprecision seems unavoidable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe neoclassical perspective argues that, in the long run, the economy will adjust back to its potential GDP level of output through flexible price levels.\nThus, the neoclassical perspective views the long-run AS curve as vertical.\nA rational expectations perspective argues that people have excellent information about economic events and how the economy works and that, as a result, price and other economic adjustments will happen very quickly.\nIn adaptive expectations theory, people have limited information about economic information and how the economy works, and so price and other economic adjustments can be slow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo rational expectations tend to look back at past experience while adaptive expectations look ahead to the future? Explain your answer.\nDoes neoclassical economics focus on the long term or the short term? Explain your answer.\nDoes neoclassical economics view prices and wages as sticky or flexible? Why?\nWhat shape is the long-run aggregate supply curve? Why does it have this shape?\nWhat is the difference between rational expectations and adaptive expectations?\nA neoclassical economist and a Keynesian economist are studying the economy of Vineland. It appears that Vineland is beginning to experience a mild recession with a decrease in aggregate demand. Which of these two economists would likely advocate that the government of Vineland take active measures to reverse this decline in aggregate demand? Why?",

Suppose a decrease in aggregate demand causes the economy to go into recession with high unemployment. The Keynesian response would be to use government policy to stimulate aggregate demand and eliminate the recessionary gap. The neoclassical economists believe that the Keynesian response, while perhaps well intentioned, will not have a good outcome for reasons we will discuss shortly. Since the neoclassical economists believe that the economy will correct itself over time, the only advantage of a Keynesian stabilization policy would be to accelerate the process and minimize the time that the unemployed are out of work. Is that the likely outcome?\nKeynesian macroeconomic policy requires some optimism about the government's ability to recognize a situation of too little or too much aggregate demand, and to adjust aggregate demand accordingly with the right level of changes in taxes or spending, all enacted in a timely fashion. After all, neoclassical economists argue, it takes government statisticians months to produce even preliminary estimates of GDP so that politicians know whether a recession is occurring—and those preliminary estimates may be revised substantially later. Moreover, there is the question of timely action. The political process can take more months to enact a tax cut or a spending increase. Political or economic considerations may determine the amount of tax or spending changes. Then the economy will take still more months to put into effect changes in aggregate demand through spending and production. When economists and policy makers consider all of these time lags and political realities, active fiscal policy may fail to address the current problem, and could even make the future economy worse. The average U.S. post-World War II recession has lasted only about a year. By the time government policy activates, the recession will likely be over. As a consequence, the only result of government fine-tuning will be to stimulate the economy when it is already recovering (or to contract the economy when it is already falling). In other words, an active macroeconomic policy is likely to exacerbate the cycles rather than dampen them. Some neoclassical economists believe a large part of the business cycles we observe are due to flawed government policy. To learn about this issue further, read the following Clear It Up feature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHY AND HOW DO ECONOMISTS MEASURE INFLATION EXPECTATIONS?\nPeople take expectations about inflation into consideration every time they make a major purchase, such as a house or a car. As inflation fluctuates, so too does the nominal interest rate on loans to buy these goods. The nominal interest rate is comprised of the real rate, plus an expected inflation factor. Expected inflation also tells economists about how the public views the economy's direction. Suppose the public expects inflation to increase. This could be the result of positive demand shock due to an expanding economy and increasing aggregate demand. It could also be the result of a negative supply shock, perhaps from rising energy prices, and decreasing aggregate supply. In either case, the public may expect the central bank to engage in contractionary monetary policy to reduce inflation, and this policy results in higher interest rates. If, however economists expect inflation to decrease, the public may anticipate a recession. In turn, the public may expect expansionary monetary policy, and lower interest rates, in the short run. By monitoring expected inflation, economists garner information about the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies. Additionally, monitoring expected inflation allows for projecting the direction of real interest rates that isolate for the effect of inflation. This information is necessary for making decisions about financing investments.\nExpectations about inflation may seem like a highly theoretical concept, but, in fact the Federal Reserve Bank measures, inflation expectations based upon early research conducted by Joseph Livingston, a financial journalist for the Philadelphia Inquirer. In 1946, he started a twice-a-year survey of economists about their expectations of inflation. After Livingston's death in 1969, the Federal Reserve Bank and other economic research agencies such as the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, the American Statistical Association, and the National Bureau of Economic Research continued the survey.\nCurrent Federal Reserve research compares these expectations to actual inflation that has occurred, and the results, so far, are mixed. Economists' forecasts, however, have become notably more accurate in the last few decades. Economists are actively researching how inflation expectations and other economic variables form and change.\n\n\n\n11.12.1 The Neoclassical Phillips Curve Tradeoff\nThe Keynesian Perspective introduced the Phillips curve and explained how it is derived from the aggregate supply curve. The short run upward sloping aggregate supply curve implies a downward sloping Phillips curve; thus, there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment in the short run. By contrast, a neoclassical long-run aggregate supply curve will imply a vertical shape for the Phillips curve, indicating no long run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.\nFigure 11.18 (a) shows the vertical AS curve, with three different levels of aggregate demand, resulting in three different equilibria, at three different price levels. At every point along that vertical AS curve, potential GDP and the rate of unemployment remains the same. Assume that for this economy, the natural rate of unemployment is 5%. As a result, the long-run Phillips curve relationship, in Figure 11.18 (b), is a vertical line, rising up from 5% unemployment, at any level of inflation. Read the following Work It Out feature for additional information on how to interpret inflation and unemployment rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.18: (a) With a vertical LRAS curve, shifts in aggregate demand do not alter the level of output but do lead to changes in the price level. Because output is unchanged between the equilibria E0, E1, and E2, all unemployment in this economy will be due to the natural rate of unemployment. (b) If the natural rate of unemployment is 5%, then the Phillips curve will be vertical. That is, regardless of changes in the price level, the unemployment rate remains at 5%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTRACKING INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT RATES\nSuppose that you have collected data for years on inflation and unemployment rates and recorded them in a table, such as Table. How do you interpret that information?\n\nInflation Rates and Unemployement Rates over Time\n\n\nYear\nInflation Rate\nUnemployment Rate\n\n\n\n\n1970\n2%\n4%\n\n\n1975\n3%\n3%\n\n\n1980\n2%\n4%\n\n\n1985\n1%\n6%\n\n\n1990\n1%\n4%\n\n\n1995\n4%\n2%\n\n\n2000\n5%\n4%\n\n\n\n\nStep 1. Plot the data points in a graph with inflation rate on the vertical\n\naxis and unemployment rate on the horizontal axis. Your graph will appear similar to Figure 11.19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.19: Unemployment Rate and Inflation Rate\n\n\n\n\nStep 2. What patterns do you see in the data? You should notice that there\n\nare years when unemployment falls but inflation rises, and other years where unemployment rises and inflation falls.\n\nStep 3. Can you determine the natural rate of unemployment from the data or\n\nfrom the graph? As you analyze the graph, it appears that the natural rate of unemployment lies at 4%. This is the rate that the economy appears to adjust back to after an apparent change in the economy. For example, in 1975 the economy appeared to have an increase in aggregate demand. The unemployment rate fell to 3% but inflation increased from 2% to 3%. By 1980, the economy had adjusted back to 4% unemployment and the inflation rate had returned to 2%. In 1985, the economy looks to have suffered a recession as unemployment rose to 6% and inflation fell to 1%. This would be consistent with a decrease in aggregate demand. By 1990, the economy recovered back to 4% unemployment, but at a lower inflation rate of 1%. In 1995 the economy again rebounded and unemployment fell to 2%, but inflation increased to 4%, which is consistent with a large increase in aggregate demand. The economy adjusted back to 4% unemployment but at a higher rate of inflation of 5%. Then in 2000, both unemployment and inflation increased to 5% and 4%, respectively.\n\nStep 4. Do you see the Phillips curve(s) in the data? If we trace the\n\ndownward sloping trend of data points, we could see a short-run Phillips curve that exhibits the inverse tradeoff between higher unemployment and lower inflation rates. If we trace the vertical line of data points, we could see a long-run Phillips curve at the 4% natural rate of unemployment.\n\n\n\n\nThe unemployment rate on the long-run Phillips curve will be the natural rate of unemployment. A small inflationary increase in the price level from AD0 to AD1 will have the same natural rate of unemployment as a larger inflationary increase in the price level from AD0 to AD2. The macroeconomic equilibrium along the vertical aggregate supply curve can occur at a variety of different price levels, and the natural rate of unemployment can be consistent with all different rates of inflation. The great economist Milton Friedman (1912–2006) summed up the neoclassical view of the long-term Phillips curve tradeoff in a 1967 speech: “[T]here is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-off.”\nIn the Keynesian perspective, the primary focus is on getting the level of aggregate demand right in relationship to an upward-sloping aggregate supply curve. That is, the government should adjust AD so that the economy produces at its potential GDP, not so low that cyclical unemployment results and not so high that inflation results. In the neoclassical perspective, aggregate supply will determine output at potential GDP, the natural rate of unemployment determines unemployment, and shifts in aggregate demand are the primary determinant of changes in the price level.\n\n\n11.12.2 Fighting Unemployment or Inflation?\nAs we explained in Unemployment, economists divide unemployment into two categories: cyclical unemployment and the natural rate of unemployment, which is the sum of frictional and structural unemployment. Cyclical unemployment results from fluctuations in the business cycle and is created when the economy is producing below potential GDP—giving potential employers less incentive to hire. When the economy is producing at potential GDP, cyclical unemployment will be zero. Because of labor market dynamics, in which people are always entering or exiting the labor force, the unemployment rate never falls to 0%, not even when the economy is producing at or even slightly above potential GDP. Probably the best we can hope for is for the number of job vacancies to equal the number of job seekers. We know that it takes time for job seekers and employers to find each other, and this time is the cause of frictional unemployment. Most economists do not consider frictional unemployment to be a “bad” thing. After all, there will always be workers who are unemployed while looking for a job that is a better match for their skills. There will always be employers that have an open position, while looking for a worker that is a better match for the job. Ideally, these matches happen quickly, but even when the economy is very strong there will be some natural unemployment and this is what the natural rate of unemployment measures.\nThe neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus attention away from the cyclical unemployment problem—that is, unemployment caused by recession—while putting more attention on the unemployment rate issue that prevails even when the economy is operating at potential GDP. To put it another way, the neoclassical view of unemployment tends to focus on how the government can adjust public policy to reduce the natural rate of unemployment. Such policy changes might involve redesigning unemployment and welfare programs so that they support those in need, but also offer greater encouragement for job-hunting. It might involve redesigning business rules with an eye to whether they are unintentionally discouraging businesses from taking on new employees. It might involve building institutions to improve the flow of information about jobs and the mobility of workers, to help bring workers and employers together more quickly. For those workers who find that their skills are permanently no longer in demand (for example, the structurally unemployed), economists can design policy to provide opportunities for retraining so that these workers can reenter the labor force and seek employment.\nNeoclassical economists will not tend to see aggregate demand as a useful tool for reducing unemployment; after all, with a vertical aggregate supply curve determining economic output, then aggregate demand has no long-run effect on unemployment. Instead, neoclassical economists believe that aggregate demand should be allowed to expand only to match the gradual shifts of aggregate supply to the right—keeping the price level much the same and inflationary pressures low.\nIf aggregate demand rises rapidly in the neoclassical model, in the long run it leads only to inflationary pressures. Figure 11.20 shows a vertical LRAS curve and three different levels of aggregate demand, rising from AD0 to AD1 to AD2. As the macroeconomic equilibrium rises from E0 to E1 to E2, the price level rises, but real GDP does not budge; nor does the rate of unemployment, which adjusts to its natural rate. Conversely, reducing inflation has no long-term costs, either. Think about Figure 11.20 in reverse, as the aggregate demand curve shifts from AD2 to AD1 to AD0, and the equilibrium moves from E2 to E1 to E0. During this process, the price level falls, but, in the long run, neither real GDP nor the natural unemployment rate changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.20: As aggregate demand shifts to the right, from AD0 to AD1 to AD2, real GDP in this economy and the level of unemployment do not change. However, there is inflationary pressure for a higher price level as the equilibrium changes from E0 to E1 to E2.\n\n\n\n\n\n11.12.3 Fighting Recession or Encouraging Long-Term Growth?\nNeoclassical economists believe that the economy will rebound out of a recession or eventually contract during an expansion because prices and wage rates are flexible and will adjust either upward or downward to restore the economy to its potential GDP. Thus, the key policy question for neoclassicals is how to promote growth of potential GDP. We know that economic growth ultimately depends on the growth rate of long-term productivity. Productivity measures how effective inputs are at producing outputs. We know that U.S. productivity has grown on average about 2% per year. That means that the same amount of inputs produce 2% more output than the year before. We also know that productivity growth varies a great deal in the short term due to cyclical factors. It also varies somewhat in the long term. From 1953–1972, U.S. labor productivity (as measured by output per hour in the business sector) grew at 3.2% per year. From 1973–1992, productivity growth declined significantly to 1.8% per year. Then, from 1993–2014, productivity growth increased slightly to 2% per year. The neoclassical economists believe the underpinnings of long-run productivity growth to be an economy’s investments in human capital, physical capital, and technology, operating together in a market-oriented environment that rewards innovation. Government policy should focus on promoting these factors.\n\n\n11.12.4 Summary of Neoclassical Macroeconomic Policy Recommendations\nLet’s summarize what neoclassical economists recommend for macroeconomic policy. Neoclassical economists do not believe in “fine-tuning” the economy. They believe that a stable economic environment with a low rate of inflation fosters economic growth. Similarly, tax rates should be low and unchanging. In this environment, private economic agents can make the best possible investment decisions, which will lead to optimal investment in physical and human capital as well as research and development to promote improvements in technology.\n\n\n11.12.5 Summary of Neoclassical Economics versus Keynesian Economics\nTable 11.2 summarizes the key differences between the two schools of thought.\n\n\n\nTable 11.2: Neoclassical versus Keynesian Economics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nNeoclassical Economics\nKeynesian Economics\n\n\n\n\nFocus: long or short-term\nLong-term\nShort-term\n\n\nPrices and wages: sticky or flexible?\nFlexible\nSticky\n\n\nEconomic output: Primarily determined by AD or AS?\nAggregate supply\nAggregate demand\n\n\nAggregate supply: vertical/ upward-sloping?\nVertical\nUpward-sloping\n\n\nPhillips curve: vertical/ downward-sloping\nVertical\nDownward sloping\n\n\nIs AD a useful tool for controlling inflation?\nYes\nYes\n\n\nWhat should be the primary area of policy emphasis for reducing unemployment?\nReform labor market\ninstitutions to reduce\nnatural rate of\nunemployment\nIncrease AD\nto eliminate cyclical\nunemployment\n\n\nIs AD a useful tool for ending recession?\nAt best, only in\nshort-run temporary\nsense, but may just\nincrease inflation\ninstead\nYes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nNeoclassical economists tend to put relatively more emphasis on long-term growth than on fighting recession, because they believe that recessions will fade in a few years and long-term growth will ultimately determine the standard of living. They tend to focus more on reducing the natural rate of unemployment caused by economic institutions and government policies than the cyclical unemployment caused by recession.\nNeoclassical economists also see no social benefit to inflation. With an upward-sloping Keynesian AS curve, inflation can arise because an economy is approaching full employment. With a vertical long-run neoclassical AS curve, inflation does not accompany any rise in output. If aggregate supply is vertical, then aggregate demand does not affect the quantity of output. Instead, aggregate demand can only cause inflationary changes in the price level.

    "text": "11.13 Balancing Keynesian and Neoclassical Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nEvaluate how neoclassical economists and Keynesian economists react to recessions\nAnalyze the interrelationship between the neoclassical and Keynesian economic models\n\n\n\nWe can compare finding the balance between Keynesian and Neoclassical models to the challenge of riding two horses simultaneously. When a circus performer stands on two horses, with a foot on each one, much of the excitement for the viewer lies in contemplating the gap between the two. As modern macroeconomists ride into the future on two horses—with one foot on the short-term Keynesian perspective and one foot on the long-term neoclassical perspective—the balancing act may look uncomfortable, but there does not seem to be any way to avoid it. Each approach, Keynesian and neoclassical, has its strengths and weaknesses.\nThe short-term Keynesian model, built on the importance of aggregate demand as a cause of business cycles and a degree of wage and price rigidity, does a sound job of explaining many recessions and why cyclical unemployment rises and falls. By focusing on the short-run aggregate demand adjustments, Keynesian economics risks overlooking the long-term causes of economic growth or the natural rate of unemployment that exist even when the economy is producing at potential GDP.\nThe neoclassical model, with its emphasis on aggregate supply, focuses on the underlying determinants of output and employment in markets, and thus tends to put more emphasis on economic growth and how labor markets work. However, the neoclassical view is not especially helpful in explaining why unemployment moves up and down over short time horizons of a few years. Nor is the neoclassical model especially helpful when the economy is mired in an especially deep and long-lasting recession, like the 1930s Great Depression. Keynesian economics tends to view inflation as a price that might sometimes be paid for lower unemployment; neoclassical economics tends to view inflation as a cost that offers no offsetting gains in terms of lower unemployment.\n\nVideo - Keynes vs. Neoclassical Economics\n\n    \n\n\nMacroeconomics cannot, however, be summed up as an argument between one group of economists who are pure Keynesians and another group who are pure neoclassicists. Instead, many mainstream economists believe both the Keynesian and neoclassical perspectives. Robert Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics in 1987, described the dual approach in this way:\nAt short time scales, I think, something sort of ‘Keynesian’ is a good approximation, and surely better than anything straight ‘neoclassical.’ At very long time scales, the interesting questions are best studied in a neoclassical framework, and attention to the Keynesian side of things would be a minor distraction. At the five-to-ten-year time scale, we have to piece things together as best we can, and look for a hybrid model that will do the job.\nMany modern macroeconomists spend considerable time and energy trying to construct models that blend the most attractive aspects of the Keynesian and neoclassical approaches. It is possible to construct a somewhat complex mathematical model where aggregate demand and sticky wages and prices matter in the short run, but wages, prices, and aggregate supply adjust in the long run. However, creating an overall model that encompasses both short-term Keynesian and long-term neoclassical models is not easy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNAVIGATING UNCHARTERED WATERS\nWere the policies that the government implemented to stabilize the economy and financial markets during the Great Recession effective? Many economists from both the Keynesian and neoclassical schools have found that they were, although to varying degrees. Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mark Zandi for Moody’s Analytics found that, without fiscal policy, GDP decline would have been significantly more than its 3.3% in 2008 followed by its 0.1% decline in 2009.\nThey also estimated that there would have been 8.5 million more job losses had the government not intervened in the market with the TARP to support the financial industry and key automakers General Motors and Chrysler. Federal Reserve Bank economists Carlos Carvalho, Stefano Eusip, and Christian Grisse found in their study, Policy Initiatives in the Global Recession: What Did Forecasters Expect? that once the government implemented policies, forecasters adapted their expectations to these policies. They were more likely to anticipate increases in investment due to lower interest rates brought on by monetary policy and increased economic growth resulting from fiscal policy.\nThe difficulty with evaluating the effectiveness of the stabilization policies that the government took in response to the Great Recession is that we will never know what would have happened had the government not implemented those policies. Surely some of the programs were more effective at creating and saving jobs, while other programs were less so. The final conclusion on the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies is still up for debate, and further study will no doubt consider the impact of these policies on the U.S. budget and deficit, as well as the U.S. dollar's value in the financial market.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe Keynesian perspective considers changes to aggregate demand to be the cause of business cycle fluctuations. Keynesians are likely to advocate that policy makers actively attempt to reverse recessionary and inflationary periods because they are not convinced that the self-correcting economy can easily return to full employment.\nThe neoclassical perspective places more emphasis on aggregate supply. Neoclassical economists believe that long term productivity growth determines the potential GDP level and that the economy typically will return to full employment after a change in aggregate demand. Skeptical of the effectiveness and timeliness of Keynesian policy, neoclassical economists are more likely to advocate a hands-off, or fairly limited, role for active stabilization policy.\nWhile Keynesians would tend to advocate an acceptable tradeoff between inflation and unemployment when counteracting a recession, neoclassical economists argue that no such tradeoff exists. Any short-term gains in lower unemployment will eventually vanish and the result of active policy will only be inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the economy is experiencing a recession, why would a neoclassical economist be unlikely to argue for aggressive policy to stimulate aggregate demand and return the economy to full employment? Explain your answer.\nIf the economy is suffering through a rampant inflationary period, would a Keynesian economist advocate for stabilization policy that involves higher taxes and higher interest rates? Explain your answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11.1: Aggregate supply (AS) slopes up, because as the price level for outputs rises, with the price of inputs remaining fixed, firms have an incentive to produce more and to earn higher profits. The potential GDP line shows the maximum that the economy can produce with full employment of workers and physical capital.\nFigure 11.2: Aggregate demand (AD) slopes down, showing that, as the price level rises, the amount of total spending on domestic goods and services declines.\nFigure 11.3: \nFigure 11.4: The equilibrium, where aggregate supply (AS) equals aggregate demand (AD), occurs at a price level of 90 and an output level of 8,800.\nFigure 11.5: Panel (a): The rise in productivity causes the SRAS curve to shift to the right. The original equilibrium E0 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS0. When SRAS shifts right, then the new equilibrium E1 is at the intersection of AD and SRAS1, and then yet another equilibrium, E2, is at the intersection of AD and SRAS2. Shifts in SRAS to the right, lead to a greater level of output and to downward pressure on the price level. Panel (b): A higher price for inputs means that at any given price level for outputs, a lower quantity will be produced so aggregate supply will shift to the left from SRAS0 to AS1. The new equilibrium, E1, has a reduced quantity of output and a higher price level than the original equilibrium (E0).\nFigure 11.6: Panel (a): An increase in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift AD to the right, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the right, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a higher quantity of output and also a higher price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new equilibrium (E1) is also closer to potential GDP. An increase in government spending or a cut in taxes that leads to a rise in consumer spending can also shift AD to the right. Panel (b): A decrease in consumer confidence or business confidence can shift AD to the left, from AD0 to AD1. When AD shifts to the left, the new equilibrium (E1) will have a lower quantity of output and also a lower price level compared with the original equilibrium (E0). In this example, the new equilibrium (E1) is also farther below potential GDP. A decrease in government spending or higher taxes that leads to a fall in consumer spending can also shift AD to the left.\nFigure 11.7: Whether the economy is in a recession is illustrated in the AD/AS model by how close the equilibrium is to the potential GDP line as indicated by the vertical LRAS line. In this example, the level of output Y0 at the equilibrium E0 is relatively far from the potential GDP line, so it can represent an economy in recession, well below the full employment level of GDP. In contrast, the level of output Y1 at the equilibrium E1 is relatively close to potential GDP, and so it would represent an economy with a lower unemployment rate.\nFigure 11.8: Panel (a): A shift in aggregate demand, from AD0 to AD1, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the original equilibrium. Panel (b): A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, will lead to a lower real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1), while the original equilibrium (E0) is at the lower price level (P0).(a) A shift in aggregate demand, from AD0 to AD1, when it happens in the area of the SRAS curve that is near potential GDP, will lead to a higher price level and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1) than the original equilibrium. (b) A shift in aggregate supply, from SRAS0 to SRAS1, will lead to a lower real GDP and to pressure for a higher price level and inflation. The new equilibrium (E1) is at a higher price level (P1), while the original equilibrium (E0) is at the lower price level (P0).\nFigure 11.9: Near the equilibrium Ek, in the Keynesian zone at the far left of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will affect the output level Yk, but will not much affect the price level. In the Keynesian zone, AD largely determines the quantity of output. Near the equilibrium En, in the neoclassical zone at the far right of the SRAS curve, small shifts in AD, either to the right or the left, will have relatively little effect on the output level Yn, but instead will have a greater effect on the price level. In the neoclassical zone, the near-vertical SRAS curve close to the level of potential GDP largely determines the quantity of output. In the intermediate zone around equilibrium Ei, movement in AD to the right will increase both the output level and the price level, while a movement in AD to the left would decrease both the output level and the price level.\nFigure 11.10: The Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.\nFigure 11.11: In both (a) and (b), demand shifts left from D0 to D1. However, the wage in (a) and the price in (b) do not immediately decline. In (a), the quantity demanded of labor at the original wage (W0) is Q0, but with the new demand curve for labor (D1), it will be Q1. Similarly, in (b), the quantity demanded of goods at the original price (P0) is Q0, but at the new demand curve (D1) it will be Q1. An excess supply of labor will exist, which we call unemployment. An excess supply of goods will also exist, where the quantity demanded is substantially less than the quantity supplied. Thus, sticky wages and sticky prices, combined with a drop in demand, bring about unemployment and recession. The Keynesian View of the AD/AS Model uses an SRAS curve, which is horizontal at levels of output below potential and vertical at potential output. Thus, when beginning from potential output, any decrease in AD affects only output, but not prices. Any increase in AD affects only prices, not output.\nFigure 11.12: Jobs lost/gained\nFigure 11.13: This figure illustrates the two key assumptions behind Keynesian economics. A recession begins when aggregate demand declines from AD0 to AD1. The recession persists because of the assumption of fixed wages and prices, which makes the SRAS flat below potential GDP. If that were not the case, the price level would fall also, raising GDP and limiting the recession. Instead the intersection E1 occurs in the flat portion of the SRAS curve where GDP is less than potential.\nFigure 11.14: Actual GDP falls below potential GDP during and after recessions, like the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82, 1990–91, 2001, and 2008–2009 and continues below potential GDP through 2016. In other cases, actual GDP can be above potential GDP for a time, as in the late 1990s.\nFigure 11.15: In the neoclassical model, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP. If AS is vertical, then it determines the level of real output, no matter where we draw the aggregate demand curve. Over time, the LRAS curve shifts to the right as productivity increases and potential GDP expands.\nFigure 11.16: The original equilibrium (E0), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts right from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is E1, with a higher output level of 550 and an increase in the price level to 125. With unemployment rates unsustainably low, eager employers bid up wages, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the left, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a higher price level of 130. Thus, the long-run aggregate supply curve (LRASn), which is vertical at the level of potential GDP, determines the level of real GDP in this economy in the long run.\nFigure 11.17: The original equilibrium (E0), at an output level of 500 and a price level of 120, happens at the intersection of the aggregate demand curve (AD0) and the short-run aggregate supply curve (SRAS0). The output at E0 is equal to potential GDP. Aggregate demand shifts left, from AD0 to AD1. The new equilibrium is at E1, with a lower output level of 450 and downward pressure on the price level of 115. With high unemployment rates, wages are held down. Lower wages are an economy-wide decrease in the price of a key input, which shifts short-run aggregate supply to the right, from SRAS0 to SRAS1. The new equilibrium (E2) is at the same original level of output, 500, but at a lower price level of 110.\nFigure 11.18: (a) With a vertical LRAS curve, shifts in aggregate demand do not alter the level of output but do lead to changes in the price level. Because output is unchanged between the equilibria E0, E1, and E2, all unemployment in this economy will be due to the natural rate of unemployment. (b) If the natural rate of unemployment is 5%, then the Phillips curve will be vertical. That is, regardless of changes in the price level, the unemployment rate remains at 5%.\nFigure 11.19: Unemployment Rate and Inflation Rate\nFigure 11.20: As aggregate demand shifts to the right, from AD0 to AD1 to AD2, real GDP in this economy and the level of unemployment do not change. However, there is inflationary pressure for a higher price level as the equilibrium changes from E0 to E1 to E2.",

When the federal government spends more money than it receives in taxes in a given year, it runs a budget deficit. Conversely, when the government receives more money in taxes than it spends in a year, it runs a budget surplus. If government spending and taxes are equal, it has a balanced budget. For example, in 2009, the U.S. government experienced its largest budget deficit ever, as the federal government spent $1.4 trillion more than it collected in taxes. This deficit was about 10% of the size of the U.S. GDP in 2009, making it by far the largest budget deficit relative to GDP since the mammoth borrowing the government used to finance World War II.\nThis section presents an overview of government spending in the United States.",

    "text": "Chapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nIdentify U.S. budget deficit and surplus trends over the past five decades\nExplain the differences between the U.S. federal budget, and state and local budgets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.1 Total U.S. Government Spending\nFederal spending in nominal dollars (that is, dollars not adjusted for inflation) has grown by a multiple of more than 38 over the last four decades, from $93.4 billion in 1960 to $3.9 trillion in 2014. Comparing spending over time in nominal dollars is misleading because it does not take into account inflation or growth in population and the real economy. A more useful method of comparison is to examine government spending as a percent of GDP over time.\nThe top line in Figure 12.2 shows the federal spending level since 1960, expressed as a share of GDP. Despite a widespread sense among many Americans that the federal government has been growing steadily larger, the graph shows that federal spending has hovered in a range from 18% to 22% of GDP most of the time since 1960.\nThe other lines in Figure 12.2 show the major federal spending categories: national defense, Social Security, health programs, and interest payments. From the graph, we see that national defense spending as a share of GDP has generally declined since the 1960s, although there were some upward bumps in the 1980s buildup under President Ronald Reagan and in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. In contrast, Social Security and healthcare have grown steadily as a percent of GDP. Healthcare expenditures include both payments for senior citizens (Medicare), and payments for low-income Americans (Medicaid). State governments also partially fund Medicaid. Interest payments are the final main category of government spending in Figure 12.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Federal Spending, 1960–2014. Since 1960, total federal spending has ranged from about 18% to 22% of GDP, although it climbed above that level in 2009, but quickly dropped back down to that level by 2013. The share that the government has spent on national defense has generally declined, while the share it has spent on Social Security and on healthcare expenses (mainly Medicare and Medicaid) has increased. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Tables B-2 and B-22, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2014/content-detail.html)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows five lines that represent different government spending from 1960 to 2014. Total federal spending has always remained above 17%. National defense has never risen above 10% and is currently closer to 5%. Social security has never risen above 5%. Net interest has always remained below 5%. Health is the only line on the graph that has primarily increased since 1960 when it was below 1% to 2014 when it was closer to 4%.\nWe broadly distinguish two types of programs in the government budget:\n\n\nentitlement programs or mandatory spending and\ndiscretionary spending programs.\n\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, spending through entitlement programs occurs without congressional or presidential action once the programs are established. Important entitlement programs are:\n\n\nMedicare (healthcare for the old),\nMedicaid (healthcare for the poor) and\nSocial Security (pension payments to the old).\n\n\nTwo thirds of the federal budget are entitlements and other mandatory spending. In order to change entitlement program spending, a law has to be passed. Because of this, changing entitlement program spending is very difficult.\nDiscretionary spending programs on the other hand can be changed by the administration on an annual basis (e.g., military spending) without changing a law and are thus easier to adjust.\nThese four categories—national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments—account for roughly 73% of all federal spending, as Figure 12.3 shows. The remaining 27% wedge of the pie chart covers all other categories of federal government spending: international affairs; science and technology; natural resources and the environment; transportation; housing; education; income support for the poor; community and regional development; law enforcement and the judicial system; and the administrative costs of running the government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Slices of Federal Spending, 2014. About 73% of government spending goes to four major areas: national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments on past borrowing. This leaves about 29% of federal spending for all other functions of the U.S. government. (Source: https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals/)\n\n\n\nThe pie chart shows that healthcare (including Medicaid) makes up roughly 26% of federal spending; Social Security makes up 24%; national defense makes up 17%; net interest makes up over 6%; and all other spending makes up over 25%.\nEach year, the government borrows funds from U.S. citizens and foreigners to cover its budget deficits. It does this by selling securities (Treasury bonds, notes, and bills)—in essence borrowing from the public and promising to repay with interest in the future. From 1961 to 1997, the U.S. government has run budget deficits, and thus borrowed funds, in almost every year. It had budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, and then returned to deficits.\nThe interest payments on past federal government borrowing were typically 1–2% of GDP in the 1960s and 1970s but then climbed above 3% of GDP in the 1980s and stayed there until the late 1990s. The government was able to repay some of its past borrowing by running surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and, with help from low interest rates, the interest payments on past federal government borrowing had fallen back to 1.4% of GDP by 2012.\nWe investigate the government borrowing and debt patterns in more detail later in this chapter, but first we need to clarify the difference between the deficit and the debt. The deficit is not the debt. The difference between the deficit and the debt lies in the time frame.\n\n\nThe government deficit (or surplus) refers to what happens with the federal government budget each year.\nThe government debt is accumulated over time. It is the sum of all past deficits and surpluses.\n\n\nIf you borrow $10,000 per year for each of the four years of college, you might say that your annual deficit was $10,000, but your accumulated debt over the four years is $40,000.\n\n\n12.1.2 State and Local Government Spending\nAlthough federal government spending often gets most of the media attention, state and local government spending is also substantial—at about $3.1 trillion in 2014. Figure 12.4 shows that state and local government spending has increased during the last four decades from around 8% to around 14% today.\nThe single biggest item is education, which accounts for about one-third of the total. The rest covers programs like highways, libraries, hospitals and healthcare, parks, and police and fire protection. Unlike the federal government, all states (except Vermont) have balanced budget laws, which means any gaps between revenues and spending must be closed by higher taxes, lower spending, drawing down their previous savings, or some combination of all of these.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.4: State and Local Spending, 1960–2013. Spending by state and local government increased from about 10% of GDP in the early 1960s to 14–16% by the mid-1970s. It has remained at roughly that level since. The single biggest spending item is education, including both K–12 spending and support for public colleges and universities, which has been about 4–5% of GDP in recent decades. Source: (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis.)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows total state and local spending (as a percentage of GDP) was around 10% in 1960, and over 14% in 2013. Education spending at the state and local levels has risen minimally since 1960 when it was under 4% to more recently when it was closer to 4.5% in 2013.\nU.S. presidential candidates often run for office pledging to improve the public schools or to get tough on crime. However, in the U.S. government system, these tasks are primarily state and local government responsibilities. In fiscal year 2014 state and local governments spent about $840 billion per year on education (including K–12 and college and university education), compared to only $100 billion by the federal government, according to usgovernmentspending.com. In other words, about 90 cents of every dollar spent on education happens at the state and local level. A politician who really wants hands-on responsibility for reforming education or reducing crime might do better to run for mayor of a large city or for state governor rather than for president of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nFiscal policy is the set of policies that relate to federal government spending, taxation, and borrowing.\nIn recent decades, the level of federal government spending and taxes, expressed as a share of GDP, has not changed much, typically fluctuating between about 18% to 22% of GDP.\nWe distinguish between entitlement programs and discretionary spending programs.\nHowever, the level of state spending and taxes, as a share of GDP, has risen from about 12–13% to about 20% of GDP over the last four decades.\nThe four main areas of federal spending are national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments, which together account for about 70% of all federal spending.\nWhen a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it is said to have a budget deficit.\nWhen a government collects more in taxes than it spends, it is said to have a budget surplus.\nIf government spending and taxes are equal, it is said to have a balanced budget.\nThe sum of all past deficits and surpluses make up the government debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen governments run budget deficits, how do they make up the differences between tax revenue and spending?\nWhen governments run budget surpluses, what is done with the extra funds?\nIs it possible for a nation to run budget deficits and still have its debt/GDP ratio fall? Explain your answer. Is it possible for a nation to run budget surpluses and still have its debt/GDP ratio rise? Explain your answer.\nGive some examples of changes in federal spending and taxes by the government that would be fiscal policy and some that would not.\nHave the spending and taxes of the U.S. federal government generally had an upward or a downward trend in the last few decades?\nWhat are the main categories of U.S. federal government spending?\nWhat is the difference between a budget deficit, a balanced budget, and a budget surplus?\nHave spending and taxes by state and local governments in the United States had a generally upward or downward trend in the last few decades?\nWhy is government spending typically measured as a percentage of GDP rather than in nominal dollars?\nWhy are expenditures such as crime prevention and education typically done at the state and local level rather than at the federal level?\nWhy is spending by the U.S. government on scientific research at NASA fiscal policy while spending by the University of Illinois is not fiscal policy?

What percentage the government collects and for what it uses that revenue varies greatly. The following sections will briefly explain the taxation system in the United States.\n\n12.2.1 Federal Taxes\nJust as many Americans erroneously think that federal spending has grown considerably, many also believe that taxes have increased substantially. The top line of Figure 12.5 shows total federal taxes as a share of GDP since 1960. Although the line rises and falls, it typically remains within the range of 17% to 20% of GDP, except for 2009, when taxes fell substantially below this level, due to recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.5: Federal Taxes, 1960–2014. Federal tax revenues have been about 17–20% of GDP during most periods in recent decades. The primary sources of federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes provide smaller shares of revenue. (Source: Economic Report of the President, 2015. Table B-21, https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/economic-report-of-the-President/2015)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows five lines that represent federal taxes (as a percentage of GDP). Total federal tax receipts was around 17% in 1960 and dropped to around 17.5% in 2014. Individual income taxes were consistently between 7% and 10%, but rose to 8% in 2014. Payroll taxes rose from under 5% in 1960 to around 6% in the 1980s. It has remained virtually consistent since then. Corporate income taxes has always remained below 5%. Excise taxes were highest in 1960 at around 2%; in 2009, it was less than 1%.\nFigure 12.5 also shows the taxation patterns for the main categories that the federal government taxes: individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, and social insurance and retirement receipts. When most people think of federal government taxes, the first tax that comes to mind is the individual income tax that is due every year on April 15 (or the first business day after). The personal income tax is the largest single source of federal government revenue, but it still represents less than half of federal tax revenue.\nThe second largest source of federal revenue is the payroll tax (captured in social insurance and retirement receipts), which provides funds for Social Security and Medicare. Payroll taxes have increased steadily over time. Together, the personal income tax and the payroll tax accounted for about 80% of federal tax revenues in 2014. Although personal income tax revenues account for more total revenue than the payroll tax, nearly three-quarters of households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes.\nThe income tax is a progressive tax, which means that the tax rates increase as a household’s income increases. Taxes also vary with marital status, family size, and other factors. The marginal tax rates (the tax due on all yearly income) for a single taxpayer range from 10% to 35%, depending on income, as the following Clear It Up feature explains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW DOES THE MARGINAL RATE WORK?\nSuppose that a single taxpayer’s income is $35,000 per year. Also suppose that income from $0 to $9,075 is taxed at 10%, income from $9,075 to $36,900 is taxed at 15%, and, finally, income from $36,900 and beyond is taxed at 25%. Since this person earns $35,000, their marginal tax rate is 15%.\n\n\nThe key fact here is that the federal income tax is designed so that tax rates increase as income increases, up to a certain level. The payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare are designed in a different way. First, the payroll taxes for Social Security are imposed at a rate of 12.4% up to a certain wage limit, set at $118,500 in 2015. Medicare, on the other hand, pays for elderly healthcare, and is fixed at 2.9%, with no upper ceiling.\nIn both cases, the employer and the employee split the payroll taxes. An employee only sees 6.2% deducted from his or her paycheck for Social Security, and 1.45% from Medicare. However, as economists are quick to point out, the employer’s half of the taxes are probably passed along to the employees in the form of lower wages, so in reality, the worker pays all of the payroll taxes.\nWe also call the Medicare payroll tax a proportional tax; that is, a flat percentage of all wages earned. The Social Security payroll tax is proportional up to the wage limit, but above that level it becomes a regressive tax, meaning that people with higher incomes pay a smaller share of their income in tax.\nThe third-largest source of federal tax revenue, as Figure 12.5 shows is the corporate income tax. The common name for corporate income is “profits.” Over time, corporate income tax receipts have declined as a share of GDP, from about 4% in the 1960s to an average of 1% to 2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s.\nThe federal government has a few other, smaller sources of revenue. It imposes an excise tax—that is, a tax on a particular good—on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol. As a share of GDP, the amount the government collects from these taxes has stayed nearly constant over time, from about 2% of GDP in the 1960s to roughly 3% by 2014, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The government also imposes an estate and gift tax on people who pass large amounts of assets to the next generation—either after death or during life in the form of gifts. These estate and gift taxes collected about 0.2% of GDP in the first decade of the 2000s. By a quirk of legislation, the government repealed the estate and gift tax in 2010, but reinstated it in 2011. Other federal taxes, which are also relatively small in magnitude, include tariffs the government collects on imported goods and charges for inspections of goods entering the country.\n\n\n12.2.2 State and Local Taxes\nAt the state and local level, taxes have been rising as a share of GDP over the last few decades to match the gradual rise in spending, as Figure 12.6 illustrates. The main revenue sources for state and local governments are sales taxes, property taxes, and revenue passed along from the federal government, but many state and local governments also levy personal and corporate income taxes, as well as impose a wide variety of fees and charges.\nThe specific sources of tax revenue vary widely across state and local governments. Some states rely more on property taxes, some on sales taxes, some on income taxes, and some more on revenues from the federal government.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.6: State and Local Tax Revenue as a Share of GDP, 1960–2014. State and local tax revenues have increased to match the rise in state and local spending. (Source: Economic Report of the President, 2015. Table B-21, https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cea/economic-report-of-the-President/2015)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that total state and local revenue (as a percentage of GDP) was less than 8% in 1960. It has decreased a bit since 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe two main federal taxes are individual income taxes and payroll taxes that provide funds for Social Security and Medicare; these taxes together account for more than 80% of federal revenues.\nOther federal taxes include the corporate income tax, excise taxes on alcohol, gasoline and tobacco, and the estate and gift tax.\nA progressive tax is one, like the federal income tax, where those with higher incomes pay a higher share of taxes out of their income than those with lower incomes.\nA proportional tax is one, like the payroll tax for Medicare, where everyone pays the same share of taxes regardless of income level.\nA regressive tax is one, like the payroll tax (above a certain threshold) that supports Social Security, where those with high income pay a lower share of income in taxes than those with lower incomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose that gifts were taxed at a rate of 10% for amounts up to $100,000 and 20% for anything over that amount. Would this tax be regressive or progressive?\nIf an individual owns a corporation for which he is the only employee, which different types of federal tax will he have to pay?\nWhat taxes would an individual pay if he were self-employed and the business is not incorporated?\nThe social security tax is 6.2% on employees’ income earned below $113,000. Is this tax progressive, regressive or proportional?\nWhat are the main categories of U.S. federal government taxes?\nWhat is the difference between a progressive tax, a proportional tax, and a regressive tax?\nExcise taxes on tobacco and alcohol and state sales taxes are often criticized for being regressive. Although everyone pays the same rate regardless of income, why might this be so?\nWhat is the benefit of having state and local taxes on income instead of collecting all such taxes at the federal level?",

    "text": "12.3 Federal Deficits and the National Debt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the U.S. federal budget in terms of annual debt and accumulated debt\nUnderstand how economic growth or decline can influence a budget surplus or budget deficit\n\n\n\nHaving discussed the revenue (taxes) and expense (spending) side of the budget, we now turn to the annual budget deficit or surplus, which is the difference between the tax revenue collected and spending over a fiscal year, which starts October 1 and ends September 30 of the next year.\nFigure 12.7 shows the pattern of annual federal budget deficits and surpluses, back to 1930, as a share of GDP. When the line is above the horizontal axis, the budget is in surplus. When the line is below the horizontal axis, a budget deficit occurred. Clearly, the biggest deficits as a share of GDP during this time were incurred to finance World War II. Deficits were also large during the 1930s, the 1980s, the early 1990s, and most recently during the 2008-2009 recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.7: Pattern of Federal Budget Deficits and Surpluses, 1929–2014. The federal government has run budget deficits for decades. The budget was briefly in surplus in the late 1990s, before heading into deficit again in the first decade of the 2000s—and especially deep deficits in the 2008-2009 recession. (Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED). http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FYFSGDA188S)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that federal deficit (as a percentage of GDP) skyrocketed between the late 1930s and mid-1940s. In 2009, it was around –10%. In 2014, the federal deficit was close to –3%.\n\n12.3.1 Debt/GDP Ratio\nAnother useful way to view the budget deficit is through the prism of accumulated debt rather than annual deficits. The national debt refers to the total amount that the government has borrowed over time. In contrast, the budget deficit refers to how much the government has borrowed in one particular year.\nFigure 12.8 shows the ratio of debt/GDP since 1940. Until the 1970s, the debt/GDP ratio revealed a fairly clear pattern of federal borrowing. The government ran up large deficits and raised the debt/GDP ratio in World War II, but from the 1950s to the 1970s the government ran either surpluses or relatively small deficits, and so the debt/GDP ratio drifted down. Large deficits in the 1980s and early 1990s caused the ratio to rise sharply. When budget surpluses arrived from 1998 to 2001, the debt/GDP ratio declined substantially. The budget deficits starting in 2002 then tugged the debt/GDP ratio higher—with a big jump when the recession took hold in 2008–2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.8: Federal Debt as a Percentage of GDP, 1942–2014. Federal debt is the sum of annual budget deficits and surpluses. Annual deficits do not always mean that the debt/GDP ratio is rising. During the 1960s and 1970s, the government often ran small deficits, but since the debt was growing more slowly than the economy, the debt/GDP ratio was declining over this time. In the 2008–2009 recession, the debt/GDP ratio rose sharply. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Table B-20, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2015/content-detail.html)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that federal debt (as a percentage of GDP) was highest in the late 1940s before steadily declining down beneath 30% in the mid-1970s. Another increase took place during the recession in 2009 where it rose to over 60% and has been rising steadily since.\nThe next Clear it Up feature discusses how the government handles the national debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE NATIONAL DEBT?\nOne year’s federal budget deficit causes the federal government to sell Treasury bonds to make up the difference between spending programs and tax revenues. The dollar value of all the outstanding Treasury bonds on which the federal government owes money is equal to the national debt.\n\n\n\n\n12.3.2 The Path from Deficits to Surpluses to Deficits\nWhy did the budget deficits suddenly turn to surpluses from 1998 to 2001 and why did the surpluses return to deficits in 2002? Why did the deficit become so large after 2007? Figure 12.9 suggests some answers. The graph combines the earlier information on total federal spending and taxes in a single graph, but focuses on the federal budget since 1990.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.9: Total Government Spending and Taxes as a Share of GDP, 1990–2014. When government spending exceeds taxes, the gap is the budget deficit. When taxes exceed spending, the gap is a budget surplus. The recessionary period starting in late 2007 saw higher spending and lower taxes, combining to create a large deficit in 2009. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Tables B-21 and B-1,\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2015/content-detail.html)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that total spending and tax receipts rise and fall in contrast to one another. In 1990, total spending was around 22% whereas tax receipts which were just under 18%. In 2014, total spending was around 22% whereas tax receipts were around 17%.\nGovernment spending as a share of GDP declined steadily through the 1990s. The biggest single reason was that defense spending declined from 5.2% of GDP in 1990 to 3.0% in 2000, but interest payments by the federal government also fell by about 1.0% of GDP. However, federal tax collections increased substantially in the later 1990s, jumping from 18.1% of GDP in 1994 to 20.8% in 2000. Powerful economic growth in the late 1990s fueled the boom in taxes. Personal income taxes rise as income goes up; payroll taxes rise as jobs and payrolls go up; corporate income taxes rise as profits go up. At the same time, government spending on transfer payments such as unemployment benefits, foods stamps, and welfare declined with more people working.\nThis sharp increase in tax revenues and decrease in expenditures on transfer payments was largely unexpected even by experienced budget analysts, and so budget surpluses came as a surprise. However, in the early 2000s, many of these factors started running in reverse. Tax revenues sagged, due largely to the recession that started in March 2001, which reduced revenues. Congress enacted a series of tax cuts and President George W. Bush signed them into law, starting in 2001. In addition, government spending swelled due to increases in defense, healthcare, education, Social Security, and support programs for those who were hurt by the recession and the slow growth that followed. Deficits returned. When the severe recession hit in late 2007, spending climbed and tax collections fell to historically unusual levels, resulting in enormous deficits.\nLonger-term U.S. budget forecasts, a decade or more into the future, predict enormous deficits. The higher deficits during the 2008-2009 recession have repercussions, and the demographics will be challenging. The primary reason is the “baby boom”—the exceptionally high birthrates that began in 1946, right after World War II, and lasted for about two decades. Starting in 2010, the front edge of the baby boom generation began to reach age 65, and in the next two decades, the proportion of Americans over the age of 65 will increase substantially. The current level of the payroll taxes that support Social Security and Medicare will fall well short of the projected expenses of these programs, as the following Clear It Up feature shows; thus, the forecast is for large budget deficits. A decision to collect more revenue to support these programs or to decrease benefit levels would alter this long-term forecast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT IS THE LONG-TERM BUDGET OUTLOOK FOR SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE?\nIn 1946, just one American in 13 was over age 65. By 2000, it was one in eight. By 2030, one American in five will be over age 65. Two enormous U.S. federal programs focus on the elderly—Social Security and Medicare. The growing numbers of elderly Americans will increase spending on these programs, as well as on Medicaid. The current payroll tax levied on workers, which supports all of Social Security and the hospitalization insurance part of Medicare, will not be enough to cover the expected costs, so what are the options?\nLong-term projections from the Congressional Budget Office in 2009 are that Medicare and Social Security spending combined will rise from 8.3% of GDP in 2009 to about 13% by 2035 and about 20% in 2080. If this rise in spending occurs, without any corresponding rise in tax collections, then some mix of changes must occur: (1) taxes will need to increase dramatically; (2) other spending will need to be cut dramatically; (3) the retirement age and/or age receiving Medicare benefits will need to increase, or (4) the federal government will need to run extremely large budget deficits.\nSome proposals suggest removing the cap on wages subject to the payroll tax, so that those with very high incomes would have to pay the tax on the entire amount of their wages. Other proposals suggest moving Social Security and Medicare from systems in which workers pay for retirees toward programs that set up accounts where workers save funds over their lifetimes and then draw out after retirement to pay for healthcare.\nThe United States is not alone in this problem. Providing the promised level of retirement and health benefits to a growing proportion of elderly with a falling proportion of workers is an even more severe problem in many European nations and in Japan. How to pay promised levels of benefits to the elderly will be a difficult public policy decision.\n\n\nIn the next module we shift to the use of fiscal policy to counteract business cycle fluctuations. In addition, we will explore proposals requiring a balanced budget—that is, for government spending and taxes to be equal each year. The Impacts of Government Borrowing will also cover how fiscal policy and government borrowing will affect national saving—and thus affect economic growth and trade imbalances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nFor most of the twentieth century, the U.S. government took on debt during wartime and then paid down that debt slowly in peacetime.\nHowever, it took on quite substantial debts in peacetime in the 1980s and early 1990s, before a brief period of budget surpluses from 1998 to 2001, followed by a return to annual budget deficits since 2002, with very large deficits in the recession of 2008 and\n\n\n\nA budget deficit or budget surplus is measured annually.\nTotal government debt or national debt is the sum of budget deficits and budget surpluses over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDebt has a certain self-reinforcing quality to it. There is one category of government spending that automatically increases along with the federal debt. What is it?\nTrue or False:\n -   Federal spending has grown substantially in recent decades.\n -   By world standards, the U.S. government controls a\n     relatively large share of the U.S. economy.\n -   A majority of the federal government's revenue is collected\n     through personal income taxes.\n -   Education spending is slightly larger at the federal level\n     than at the state and local level.\n -   State and local government spending has not risen much in\n     recent decades.\n -   Defense spending is higher now than ever.\n -   The share of the economy going to federal taxes has\n     increased substantially over time.\n -   Foreign aid is a large portion, although less than half, of\n     federal spending.\n -   Federal deficits have been very large for the last two\n     decades.\n -   The accumulated federal debt as a share of GDP is near an\n     all-time high.\nWhat has been the general pattern of U.S. budget deficits in recent decades?\nWhat is the difference between a budget deficit and the national debt?\nIn a booming economy, is the federal government more likely to run surpluses or deficits?

    "text": "12.4 Using Fiscal Policy to Fight Recession, Unemployment, and Inflation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain how expansionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence the economy\nExplain how contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and influence the economy\n\n\n\nFiscal policy is the use of government spending and tax policy to influence the path of the economy over time. Graphically, we see that fiscal policy, whether through changes in spending or taxes, shifts the aggregate demand outward in the case of expansionary fiscal policy and inward in the case of contractionary fiscal policy. We know from the chapter on economic growth that over time the quantity and quality of our resources grow as the population and thus the labor force get larger, as businesses invest in new capital, and as technology improves. The result of this is regular shifts to the right of the aggregate supply curves, as Figure 12.10 illustrates.\nThe original equilibrium occurs at E0, the intersection of aggregate demand curve AD0 and aggregate supply curve SRAS0, at an output level of 200 and a price level of 90. One year later, aggregate supply has shifted to the right to SRAS1 in the process of long-term economic growth, and aggregate demand has also shifted to the right to AD1, keeping the economy operating at the new level of potential GDP.\nThe new equilibrium (E1) is an output level of 206 and a price level of 92. One more year later, aggregate supply has again shifted to the right, now to SRAS2, and aggregate demand shifts right as well to AD2. Now the equilibrium is E2, with an output level of 212 and a price level of 94. In short, Figure 12.10 shows an economy that is growing steadily year to year, producing at its potential GDP each year, with only small inflationary increases in the price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.10: In this well-functioning economy, each year aggregate supply and aggregate demand shift to the right so that the economy proceeds from equilibrium E0 to E1 to E2. Each year, the economy produces at potential GDP with only a small inflationary increase in the price level. However, if aggregate demand does not smoothly shift to the right and match increases in aggregate supply, growth with deflation can develop.\n\n\n\nAggregate demand and aggregate supply do not always move neatly together. Think about what causes shifts in aggregate demand over time. As aggregate supply increases, incomes tend to go up. This tends to increase consumer and investment spending, shifting the aggregate demand curve to the right, but in any given period it may not shift the same amount as aggregate supply. What happens to government spending and taxes? Government spends to pay for the ordinary business of government- items such as national defense, social security, and healthcare, as Figure shows. Tax revenues, in part, pay for these expenditures. The result may be an increase in aggregate demand more than or less than the increase in aggregate supply. Aggregate demand may fail to increase along with aggregate supply, or aggregate demand may even shift left, for a number of possible reasons: households become hesitant about consuming; firms decide against investing as much; or perhaps the demand from other countries for exports diminishes.\nFor example, investment by private firms in physical capital in the U.S. economy boomed during the late 1990s, rising from 14.1% of GDP in 1993 to 17.2% in 2000, before falling back to 15.2% by 2002. Conversely, if shifts in aggregate demand run ahead of increases in aggregate supply, inflationary increases in the price level will result. Business cycles of recession and recovery are the consequence of shifts in aggregate supply and aggregate demand. As these occur, the government may choose to use fiscal policy to address the difference.\nMonetary Policy and Bank Regulation shows us that a central bank can use its powers over the banking system to engage in countercyclical—or “against the business cycle”—actions. If recession threatens, the central bank uses an expansionary monetary policy to increase the money supply, increase the quantity of loans, reduce interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the right. If inflation threatens, the central bank uses contractionary monetary policy to reduce the money supply, reduce the quantity of loans, raise interest rates, and shift aggregate demand to the left. Fiscal policy is another macroeconomic policy tool for adjusting aggregate demand by using either government spending or taxation policy.\n\n12.4.1 Expansionary Fiscal Policy\nExpansionary fiscal policy increases the level of aggregate demand, through either increases in government spending or reductions in tax rates. Expansionary policy can do this by (1) increasing consumption by raising disposable income through cuts in personal income taxes or payroll taxes; (2) increasing investment spending by raising after-tax profits through cuts in business taxes; and (3) increasing government purchases through increased federal government spending on final goods and services and raising federal grants to state and local governments to increase their expenditures on final goods and services. Contractionary fiscal policy does the reverse: it decreases the level of aggregate demand by decreasing consumption, decreasing investment, and decreasing government spending, either through cuts in government spending or increases in taxes. The aggregate demand/aggregate supply model is useful in judging whether expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy is appropriate.\nConsider first the situation in Figure 12.11, which is similar to the U.S. economy during the 2008-2009 recession. The intersection of aggregate demand (AD0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) is occurring below the level of potential GDP as the LRAS curve indicates. At the equilibrium (E0), a recession occurs and unemployment rises. In this case, expansionary fiscal policy using tax cuts or increases in government spending can shift aggregate demand to AD1, closer to the full-employment level of output. In addition, the price level would rise back to the level P1 associated with potential GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.11: Expansionary Fiscal Policy. The original equilibrium (E0) represents a recession, occurring at a quantity of output (Y0) below potential GDP. However, a shift of aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1, enacted through an expansionary fiscal policy, can move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E1 at the level of potential GDP which the LRAS curve shows. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP, any inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1 that results should be relatively small.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows two aggregate demand curves that each intersect with an aggregate supply curve. Aggregate demand curve (AD sub 1) intersects with both the aggregate supply curve (AS sub 0) as well as the potential GDP line.\nShould the government use tax cuts or spending increases, or a mix of the two, to carry out expansionary fiscal policy? During the 2008-2009 Great Recession (which started, actually, in late 2007), the U.S. economy suffered a 3.1% cumulative loss of GDP. That may not sound like much, but it’s more than one year’s average growth rate of GDP. Over that time frame, the unemployment rate doubled from 5% to 10%. The consensus view is that this was possibly the worst economic downturn in U.S. history since the 1930’s Great Depression. The choice between whether to use tax or spending tools often has a political tinge. As a general statement, conservatives and Republicans prefer to see expansionary fiscal policy carried out by tax cuts, while liberals and Democrats prefer that the government implement expansionary fiscal policy through spending increases. In a bipartisan effort to address the extreme situation, the Obama administration and Congress passed an $830 billion expansionary policy in early 2009 involving both tax cuts and increases in government spending. At the same time, however, the federal stimulus was partially offset when state and local governments, whose budgets were hard hit by the recession, began cutting their spending.\nThe conflict over which policy tool to use can be frustrating to those who want to categorize economics as “liberal” or “conservative,” or who want to use economic models to argue against their political opponents. However, advocates of smaller government, who seek to reduce taxes and government spending can use the AD AS model, as well as advocates of bigger government, who seek to raise taxes and government spending. Economic studies of specific taxing and spending programs can help inform decisions about whether the government should change taxes or spending, and in what ways. Ultimately, decisions about whether to use tax or spending mechanisms to implement macroeconomic policy is a political decision rather than a purely economic one.\n\n\n12.4.2 Contractionary Fiscal Policy\nFiscal policy can also contribute to pushing aggregate demand beyond potential GDP in a way that leads to inflation. As Figure 12.12 shows, a very large budget deficit pushes up aggregate demand, so that the intersection of aggregate demand (AD0) and aggregate supply (SRAS0) occurs at equilibrium E0, which is an output level above potential GDP. Economists sometimes call this an “overheating economy” where demand is so high that there is upward pressure on wages and prices, causing inflation. In this situation, contractionary fiscal policy involving federal spending cuts or tax increases can help to reduce the upward pressure on the price level by shifting aggregate demand to the left, to AD1, and causing the new equilibrium E1 to be at potential GDP, where aggregate demand intersects the LRAS curve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.12: A Contractionary Fiscal Policy. The economy starts at the equilibrium quantity of output Y0, which is above potential GDP. The extremely high level of aggregate demand will generate inflationary increases in the price level. A contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand down from AD0 to AD1, leading to a new equilibrium output E1, which occurs at potential GDP, where AD1 intersects the LRAS curve.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows two aggregate demand curves that each intersect with an aggregate supply curve.

    "text": "12.5 Automatic Stabilizers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nDescribe how the federal government can use discretionary fiscal policy to stabilize the economy\nIdentify examples of automatic stabilizers\nUnderstand how a government can use standardized employment budget to identify automatic stabilizers\n\n\n\nThe millions of unemployed in 2008–2009 could collect unemployment insurance benefits to replace some of their salaries. Federal fiscal policies include discretionary fiscal policy, when the government passes a new law that explicitly changes tax or spending levels. The 2009 stimulus package is an example. Changes in tax and spending levels can also occur automatically, due to automatic stabilizers, such as unemployment insurance and food stamps, which are programs that are already laws that stimulate aggregate demand in a recession and hold down aggregate demand in a potentially inflationary boom.\n\n12.5.1 Counterbalancing Recession and Boom\nConsider first the situation where aggregate demand has risen sharply, causing the equilibrium to occur at a level of output above potential GDP. This situation will increase inflationary pressure in the economy. The policy prescription in this setting would be a dose of contractionary fiscal policy, implemented through some combination of higher taxes and lower spending. To some extent, both changes happen automatically. On the tax side, a rise in aggregate demand means that workers and firms throughout the economy earn more. Because taxes are based on personal income and corporate profits, a rise in aggregate demand automatically increases tax payments. On the spending side, stronger aggregate demand typically means lower unemployment and fewer layoffs, and so there is less need for government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, Medicaid, and other programs in the social safety net.\nThe process works in reverse, too. If aggregate demand were to fall sharply so that a recession occurs, then the prescription would be for expansionary fiscal policy—some mix of tax cuts and spending increases. The lower level of aggregate demand and higher unemployment will tend to pull down personal incomes and corporate profits, an effect that will reduce the amount of taxes owed automatically. Higher unemployment and a weaker economy should lead to increased government spending on unemployment benefits, welfare, and other similar domestic programs. In 2009, the stimulus package included an extension in the time allowed to collect unemployment insurance. In addition, the automatic stabilizers react to a weakening of aggregate demand with expansionary fiscal policy and react to a strengthening of aggregate demand with contractionary fiscal policy, just as the AD/AS analysis suggests.\nA combination of automatic stabilizers and discretionary fiscal policy produced the very large budget deficit in 2009. The Great Recession, starting in late 2007, meant less tax-generating economic activity, which triggered the automatic stabilizers that reduce taxes. Most economists, even those who are concerned about a possible pattern of persistently large budget deficits, are much less concerned or even quite supportive of larger budget deficits in the short run of a few years during and immediately after a severe recession.\nA glance back at economic history provides a second illustration of the power of automatic stabilizers. Remember that the length of economic upswings between recessions has become longer in the U.S. economy in recent decades (as we discussed in Unemployment). The three longest economic booms of the twentieth century happened in the 1960s, the 1980s, and the 1991–2001 time period. One reason why the economy has tipped into recession less frequently in recent decades is that the size of government spending and taxes has increased in the second half of the twentieth century. Thus, the automatic stabilizing effects from spending and taxes are now larger than they were in the first half of the twentieth century. Around 1900, for example, federal spending was only about 2% of GDP. In 1929, just before the Great Depression hit, government spending was still just 4% of GDP. In those earlier times, the smaller size of government made automatic stabilizers far less powerful than in the last few decades, when government spending often hovers at 20% of GDP or more.\n\n\n12.5.2 The Standardized Employment Deficit or Surplus\nEach year, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculates the standardized employment budget—that is, what the budget deficit or surplus would be if the economy were producing at potential GDP, where people who look for work were finding jobs in a reasonable period of time and businesses were making normal profits, with the result that both workers and businesses would be earning more and paying more taxes. In effect, the standardized employment deficit eliminates the impact of the automatic stabilizers. Figure 12.13 compares the actual budget deficits of recent decades with the CBO’s standardized deficit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.13: Comparison of Actual Budget Deficits with the Standardized Employment Deficit. When the economy is in recession, the standardized employment budget deficit is less than the actual budget deficit because the economy is below potential GDP, and the automatic stabilizers are reducing taxes and increasing spending. When the economy is performing extremely well, the standardized employment deficit (or surplus) is higher than the actual budget deficit (or surplus) because the economy is producing about potential GDP, so the automatic stabilizers are increasing taxes and reducing the need for government spending. (Sources: Actual and Cyclically Adjusted Budget Surpluses/Deficits, http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43977; and Economic Report of the President, Table B-1, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2013/content-detail.html)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows how the standardized deficit surplus and the actual deficit surplus have changed since 1970. Both lines tend to rise and fall at similar times. The only time both were positive numbers was between the mid-1990s and early 2000s. As of 2014, both standardized deficit surplus and actual deficit surplus had dropped to their lowest amount, both below –6%.\nNotice that in recession years, like the early 1990s, 2001, or 2009, the standardized employment deficit is smaller than the actual deficit. During recessions, the automatic stabilizers tend to increase the budget deficit, so if the economy was instead at full employment, the deficit would be reduced. However, in the late 1990s the standardized employment budget surplus was lower than the actual budget surplus. The gap between the standardized budget deficit or surplus and the actual budget deficit or surplus shows the impact of the automatic stabilizers. More generally, the standardized budget figures allow you to see what the budget deficit would look like with the economy held constant—at its potential GDP level of output.\nAutomatic stabilizers occur quickly. Lower wages means that a lower amount of taxes is withheld from paychecks right away. Higher unemployment or poverty means that government spending in those areas rises as quickly as people apply for benefits. However, while the automatic stabilizers offset part of the shifts in aggregate demand, they do not offset all or even most of it. Historically, automatic stabilizers on the tax and spending side offset about 10% of any initial movement in the level of output. This offset may not seem enormous, but it is still useful. Automatic stabilizers, like shock absorbers in a car, can be useful if they reduce the impact of the worst bumps, even if they do not eliminate the bumps altogether.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nFiscal policy is conducted both through discretionary fiscal policy, which occurs when the government enacts taxation or spending changes in response to economic events, or through automatic stabilizers, which are taxing and spending mechanisms that, by their design, shift in response to economic events without any further legislation.\nThe standardized employment budget is the calculation of what the budget deficit or budget surplus would have been in a given year if the economy had been producing at its potential GDP in that year.\nMany economists and politicians criticize the use of fiscal policy for a variety of reasons, including concerns over time lags, the impact on interest rates, and the inherently political nature of fiscal policy.\nWe cover the critique of fiscal policy in the next module.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a recession, does the actual budget surplus or deficit fall above or below the standardized employment budget?\nWhat is the main advantage of automatic stabilizers over discretionary fiscal policy?\nExplain how automatic stabilizers work, both on the taxation side and on the spending side, first in a situation where the economy is producing less than potential GDP and then in a situation where the economy is producing more than potential GDP.\nWhat is the difference between discretionary fiscal policy and automatic stabilizers?\nWhy do automatic stabilizers function “automatically?”\nWhat is the standardized employment budget?\nIs Medicaid (federal government aid to low-income families and individuals) an automatic stabilizer?",

    "text": "12.6 Practical Problems with Discretionary Fiscal Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand how fiscal policy and monetary policy are interconnected\nExplain the three lag times that often occur when solving economic problems\nIdentify the legal and political challenges of responding to an economic problem\n\n\n\nIn the early 1960s, many leading economists believed that the problem of the business cycle, and the swings between cyclical unemployment and inflation, were a thing of the past. On the cover of its December 31, 1965, issue, Time magazine, then the premier news magazine in the United States, ran a picture of John Maynard Keynes, and the story inside identified Keynesian theories as “the prime influence on the world’s economies.” The article reported that policymakers have “used Keynesian principles not only to avoid the violent [business] cycles of prewar days but to produce phenomenal economic growth and to achieve remarkably stable prices.”\nThis happy consensus, however, did not last. The U.S. economy suffered one recession from December 1969 to November 1970, a deeper recession from November 1973 to March 1975, and then double-dip recessions from January to June 1980 and from July 1981 to November 1982. At various times, inflation and unemployment both soared. Clearly, the problems of macroeconomic policy had not been completely solved. As economists began to consider what had gone wrong, they identified a number of issues that make discretionary fiscal policy more difficult than it had seemed in the rosy optimism of the mid-1960s.\n\n12.6.1 Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates\nBecause fiscal policy affects the quantity that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only affects aggregate demand—it can also affect interest rates. In Figure 12.14, the original equilibrium (E0) in the financial capital market occurs at a quantity of $800 billion and an interest rate of 6%. However, an increase in government budget deficits shifts the demand for financial capital from D0 to D1. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at a quantity of $900 billion and an interest rate of 7%.\nA consensus estimate based on a number of studies is that an increase in budget deficits (or a fall in budget surplus) by 1% of GDP will cause an increase of 0.5–1.0% in the long-term interest rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.14: Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates. When a government borrows money in the financial capital market, it causes a shift in the demand for financial capital from D0 to D1. As the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the equilibrium interest rate rises from 6% to 7% in this example. In this way, an expansionary fiscal policy intended to shift aggregate demand to the right can also lead to a higher interest rate, which has the effect of shifting aggregate demand back to the left.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows two demand curves that each intersect with a supply curve. Demand curve (D sub 0) intersects with supply curve (S) at E sub 0 (point $800, 6%). Demand curve (D sub 1) intersects with supply curve (S) at E sub 1 (point $900, 7%).\nA problem arises here. An expansionary fiscal policy, with tax cuts or spending increases, is intended to increase aggregate demand. If an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending (as occurs with tight monetary policy), thus reducing aggregate demand. Even if the direct effect of expansionary fiscal policy on increasing demand is not totally offset by lower aggregate demand from higher interest rates, fiscal policy can end up less powerful than was originally expected. We refer to this as crowding out, where government borrowing and spending results in higher interest rates, which reduces business investment and household consumption.\nThe broader lesson is that the government must coordinate fiscal and monetary policy. If expansionary fiscal policy is to work well, then the central bank can also reduce or keep short-term interest rates low. Conversely, monetary policy can also help to ensure that contractionary fiscal policy does not lead to a recession.\n\n\n12.6.2 Long and Variable Time Lags\nThe government can change monetary policy several times each year, but it takes much longer to enact fiscal policy. Imagine that the economy starts to slow down. It often takes some months before the economic statistics signal clearly that a downturn has started, and a few months more to confirm that it is truly a recession and not just a one- or two-month blip. Economists often call the time it takes to determine that a recession has occurred the recognition lag. After this lag, policymakers become aware of the problem and propose fiscal policy bills. The bills go into various congressional committees for hearings, negotiations, votes, and then, if passed, eventually for the president’s signature.\n\nInside Lag\n\nMany fiscal policy bills about spending or taxes propose changes that would start in the next budget year or would be phased in gradually over time. Economists often refer to the time it takes to pass a bill as the legislative lag or inside lag.\n\nOutside Lag\n\nFinally, once the government passes the bill it takes some time to disperse the funds to the appropriate agencies to implement the programs. Economists call the time it takes to start the projects the implementation lag or outside lag.\n\n\nMoreover, the exact level of fiscal policy that the government should implement is never completely clear. Should it increase the budget deficit by 0.5% of GDP? By 1% of GDP? By 2% of GDP? In an AD/AS diagram, it is straightforward to sketch an aggregate demand curve shifting to the potential GDP level of output. In the real world, we only know roughly, not precisely, the actual level of potential output, and exactly how a spending cut or tax increase will affect aggregate demand is always somewhat controversial. Also unknown is the state of the economy at any point in time. During the early days of the Obama administration, for example, no one knew the true extent of the economy's deficit. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the rapid collapse of the banking system and automotive sector made it difficult to assess how quickly the economy was collapsing.\nThus, it can take many months or even more than a year to begin an expansionary fiscal policy after a recession has started—and even then, uncertainty will remain over exactly how much to expand or contract taxes and spending. When politicians attempt to use countercyclical fiscal policy to fight recession or inflation, they run the risk of responding to the macroeconomic situation of two or three years ago, in a way that may be exactly wrong for the economy at that time. George P. Schultz, a professor of economics, former Secretary of the Treasury, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget, once wrote: “While the economist is accustomed to the concept of lags, the politician likes instant results. The tension comes because, as I have seen on many occasions, the economist’s lag is the politician’s nightmare.”\n\n\n12.6.3 Temporary and Permanent Fiscal Policy\nA temporary tax cut or spending increase will explicitly last only for a year or two, and then revert to its original level. A permanent tax cut or spending increase is expected to stay in place for the foreseeable future. The effect of temporary and permanent fiscal policies on aggregate demand can be very different. Consider how you would react if the government announced a tax cut that would last one year and then be repealed, in comparison with how you would react if the government announced a permanent tax cut. Most people and firms will react more strongly to a permanent policy change than a temporary one.\nThis fact creates an unavoidable difficulty for countercyclical fiscal policy. The appropriate policy may be to have an expansionary fiscal policy with large budget deficits during a recession, and then a contractionary fiscal policy with budget surpluses when the economy is growing well. However, if both policies are explicitly temporary ones, they will have a less powerful effect than a permanent policy.\n\n\n12.6.4 Structural Economic Change Takes Time\nWhen an economy recovers from a recession, it does not usually revert to its exact earlier shape. Instead, the economy's internal structure evolves and changes and this process can take time. For example, much of the economic growth of the mid-2000s was in the construction sector (especially of housing) and finance. However, when housing prices started falling in 2007 and the resulting financial crunch led into recession (as we discussed in Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation), both sectors contracted. The manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy has been losing jobs in recent years as well, under pressure from technological change and foreign competition. Many of the people who lost work from these sectors in the 2008-2009 Great Recession will never return to the same jobs in the same sectors of the economy. Instead, the economy will need to grow in new and different directions, as the following Clear It Up feature shows. Fiscal policy can increase overall demand, but the process of structural economic change—the expansion of a new set of industries and the movement of workers to those industries—inevitably takes time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHY DO JOBS VANISH?\nPeople can lose jobs for a variety of reasons: because of a recession, but also because of longer-run changes in the economy, such as new technology. Productivity improvements in auto manufacturing, for example, can reduce the number of workers needed, and eliminate these jobs in the long run. The internet has created jobs but also caused job loss, from travel agents to book store clerks. Many of these jobs may never come back. Short-run fiscal policy to reduce unemployment can create jobs, but it cannot replace jobs that will never return.\n\n\n\n\n12.6.5 The Limitations of Fiscal Policy\nFiscal policy can help an economy that is producing below its potential GDP to expand aggregate demand so that it produces closer to potential GDP, thus lowering unemployment. However, fiscal policy cannot help an economy produce at an output level above potential GDP without causing inflation At this point, unemployment becomes so low that workers become scarce and wages rise rapidly.\n\n\n12.6.6 Political Realties and Discretionary Fiscal Policy\nA final problem for discretionary fiscal policy arises out of the difficulties of explaining to politicians how countercyclical fiscal policy that runs against the tide of the business cycle should work. Some politicians have a gut-level belief that when the economy and tax revenues slow down, it is time to hunker down, pinch pennies, and trim expenses. Countercyclical policy, however, says that when the economy has slowed, it is time for the government to stimulate the economy, raising spending, and cutting taxes. This offsets the drop in the economy in the other sectors. Conversely, when economic times are good and tax revenues are rolling in, politicians often feel that it is time for tax cuts and new spending. However, countercyclical policy says that this economic boom should be an appropriate time for keeping taxes high and restraining spending.\nPoliticians tend to prefer expansionary fiscal policy over contractionary policy. There is rarely a shortage of proposals for tax cuts and spending increases, especially during recessions. However, politicians are less willing to hear the message that in good economic times, they should propose tax increases and spending limits. In the economic upswing of the late 1990s and early 2000s, for example, the U.S. GDP grew rapidly. Estimates from respected government economic forecasters like the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget stated that the GDP was above potential GDP, and that unemployment rates were unsustainably low. However, no mainstream politician took the lead in saying that the booming economic times might be an appropriate time for spending cuts or tax increases. As of February 2017, President Trump has expressed plans to increase spending on national defense by 10% or $54 billion, increase infrastructure investment by $1 trillion, cut corporate and personal income taxes, all while maintaining the existing spending on Social Security and Medicare. The only way this math adds up is with a sizeable increase in the Federal budget deficit.\n\n\n12.6.7 Discretionary Fiscal Policy: Summing Up\nExpansionary fiscal policy can help to end recessions and contractionary fiscal policy can help to reduce inflation. Given the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags, temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers had concluded by the mid-1990s that discretionary fiscal policy was a blunt instrument, more like a club than a scalpel. It might still make sense to use it in extreme economic situations, like an especially deep or long recession. For less extreme situations, it was often preferable to let fiscal policy work through the automatic stabilizers and focus on monetary policy to steer short-term countercyclical efforts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nBecause fiscal policy affects the quantity of money that the government borrows in financial capital markets, it not only affects aggregate demand—it can also affect interest rates.\nIf an expansionary fiscal policy also causes higher interest rates, then firms and households are discouraged from borrowing and spending, reducing aggregate demand in a situation called crowding out.\nGiven the uncertainties over interest rate effects, time lags (implementation lag, legislative lag, and recognition lag), temporary and permanent policies, and unpredictable political behavior, many economists and knowledgeable policymakers have concluded that discretionary fiscal policy is a blunt instrument and better used only in extreme situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would happen if expansionary fiscal policy was implemented in a recession but, due to lag, did not actually take effect until after the economy was back to potential GDP?\nWhat would happen if contractionary fiscal policy were implemented during an economic boom but, due to lag, it did not take effect until the economy slipped into recession?\nDo you think the typical time lag for fiscal policy is likely to be longer or shorter than the time lag for monetary policy?

    "text": "12.7 The Question of a Balanced Budget\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand the arguments for and against requiring the U.S. federal budget to be balanced\nConsider the long-run and short-run effects of a federal budget deficit\n\n\n\nFor many decades, going back to the 1930s, various legislators have put forward proposals to require that the U.S. government balance its budget every year. In 1995, a proposed constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a wide margin, and failed in the U.S. Senate by only a single vote. (For the balanced budget to have become an amendment to the Constitution would have required a two-thirds vote by Congress and passage by three-quarters of the state legislatures.)\nMost economists view the proposals for a perpetually balanced budget with bemusement. After all, in the short term, economists would expect the budget deficits and surpluses to fluctuate up and down with the economy and the automatic stabilizers. Economic recessions should automatically lead to larger budget deficits or smaller budget surpluses, while economic booms lead to smaller deficits or larger surpluses. A requirement that the budget be balanced each and every year would prevent these automatic stabilizers from working and would worsen the severity of economic fluctuations.\nSome supporters of the balanced budget amendment like to argue that, since households must balance their own budgets, the government should too. However, this analogy between household and government behavior is severely flawed. Most households do not balance their budgets every year. Some years households borrow to buy houses or cars or to pay for medical expenses or college tuition. Other years they repay loans and save funds in retirement accounts. After retirement, they withdraw and spend those savings. Also, the government is not a household for many reasons, one of which is that the government has macroeconomic responsibilities. The argument of Keynesian macroeconomic policy is that the government needs to lean against the wind, spending when times are hard and saving when times are good, for the sake of the overall economy.\nThere is also no particular reason to expect a government budget to be balanced in the medium term of a few years. For example, a government may decide that by running large budget deficits, it can make crucial long-term investments in human capital and physical infrastructure that will build the country's long-term productivity. These decisions may work out well or poorly, but they are not always irrational. Such policies of ongoing government budget deficits may persist for decades. As the U.S. experience from the end of World War II up to about 1980 shows, it is perfectly possible to run budget deficits almost every year for decades, but as long as the percentage increases in debt are smaller than the percentage growth of GDP, the debt/GDP ratio will decline at the same time.\nNothing in this argument is a claim that budget deficits are always a wise policy. In the short run, a government that runs a very large budget deficit can shift aggregate demand to the right and trigger severe inflation. Additionally, governments may borrow for foolish or impractical reasons. The Impacts of Government Borrowing will discuss how large budget deficits, by reducing national saving, can in certain cases reduce economic growth and even contribute to international financial crises. A requirement that the budget be balanced in each calendar year, however, is a misguided overreaction to the fear that in some cases, budget deficits can become too large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNO YELLOWSTONE PARK?\nThe 2013 federal budget shutdown illustrated the many sides to fiscal policy and the federal budget. In 2013, Republicans and Democrats could not agree on which spending policies to fund and how large the government debt should be. Due to the severity of the 2008-2009 recession, the fiscal stimulus, and previous policies, the federal budget deficit and debt was historically high. One way to try to cut federal spending and borrowing was to refuse to raise the legal federal debt limit, or tie on conditions to appropriation bills to stop the Affordable Health Care Act. This disagreement led to a two-week federal government shutdown and got close to the deadline where the federal government would default on its Treasury bonds. Finally, however, a compromise emerged and the government avoided default. This shows clearly how closely fiscal policies are tied to politics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nBalanced budget amendments are a popular political idea, but the economic merits behind such proposals are questionable.\nMost economists accept that fiscal policy needs to be flexible enough to accommodate unforeseen expenditures, such as wars or recessions.\nWhile persistent, large budget deficits can indeed be a problem, a balanced budget amendment prevents even small, temporary deficits that might, in some cases, be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow would a balanced budget amendment affect a decision by Congress to grant a tax cut during a recession?\nHow would a balanced budget amendment change the effect of automatic stabilizer programs?\nWhat are some of the arguments for and against a requirement that the federal government budget be balanced every year?\nDo you agree or disagree with this statement: “It is in the best interest of our economy for Congress and the President to run a balanced budget each year.” Explain your answer.\nDuring the Great Recession of 2008–2009, what actions would have been required of Congress and the President had a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution been ratified? What impact would that have had on the unemployment rate?",

Any spending should be tempered by fiscal responsibility and by looking carefully at the spending’s impact. When a government spends more than it collects in taxes, it runs a budget deficit. It then needs to borrow. When government borrowing becomes especially large and sustained, it can substantially reduce the financial capital available to private sector firms, as well as lead to trade imbalances and even financial crises.\nThe Government Budgets and Fiscal Policy chapter introduced the concepts of deficits and debt, as well as how a government could use fiscal policy to address recession or inflation. This chapter begins by building on the national savings and investment identity, which we first first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter, to show how government borrowing affects firms’ physical capital investment levels and trade balances. A prolonged period of budget deficits may lead to lower economic growth, in part because the funds that the government borrows to fund its budget deficits are typically no longer available for private investment. Moreover, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits can lead to disruptive economic patterns of high inflation, substantial inflows of financial capital from abroad, plummeting exchange rates, and heavy strains on a country’s banking and financial system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.15: President Lyndon Johnson played a pivotal role in financing higher education. (Credit: modification of image by LBJ Museum & Library)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFINANCING HIGHER EDUCATION\nOn November 8, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed The Higher Education Act of 1965 into law. With a stroke of the pen, he implemented what we know as the financial aid, work study, and student loan programs to help Americans pay for a college education. In his remarks, the President said:\nHere the seeds were planted from which grew my firm conviction that for the individual, education is the path to achievement and fulfillment; for the Nation, it is a path to a society that is not only free but civilized; and for the world, it is the path to peace—for it is education that places reason over force.\nThis Act, he said, \"is responsible for funding higher education for millions of Americans. It is the embodiment of the United States’ investment in ‘human capital’.\" Since Johnson signed the Act into law, the government has renewed it several times.\nThe purpose of The Higher Education Act of 1965 was to build the country’s human capital by creating educational opportunity for millions of Americans. The three criteria that the government uses to judge eligibility are income, full-time or part-time attendance, and the cost of the institution. According to the 2011–2012 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS:12), in the 2011–2012 school year, over 70% of all full-time college students received some form of federal financial aid; 47% received grants; and another 55% received federal government student loans. The budget to support financial aid has increased not only because of more enrollment, but also because of increased tuition and fees for higher education. The current Trump administration is currently questioning these increases and the entire notion of how the government should deal with higher education. The President and Congress are charged with balancing fiscal responsibility and important government-financed expenditures like investing in human capital.",

    "text": "12.9 How Government Borrowing Affects Investment and the Trade Balance\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the national saving and investment identity in terms of demand and supply\nEvaluate the role of budget surpluses and trade surpluses in national saving and investment identity\n\n\n\nWhen governments are borrowers in financial markets, there are three possible sources for the funds from a macroeconomic point of view: (1) households might save more; (2) private firms might borrow less; and (3) the additional funds for government borrowing might come from outside the country, from foreign financial investors. Let’s begin with a review of why one of these three options must occur, and then explore how interest rates and exchange rates adjust to these connections.\n\n12.9.1 The National Saving and Investment Identity\nThe national saving and investment identity, which we first introduced in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter, provides a framework for showing the relationships between the sources of demand and supply in financial capital markets. The identity begins with a statement that must always hold true: the quantity of financial capital supplied in the market must equal the quantity of financial capital demanded.\nThe U.S. economy has two main sources for financial capital: private savings from inside the U.S. economy and public savings.\n\\[\\text{Total savings} = \\text{Private savings (S)} + \\text{Public savings (T – G)}\\]\nThese include the inflow of foreign financial capital from abroad. The inflow of savings from abroad is, by definition, equal to the trade deficit, as we explained in The International Trade and Capital Flows chapter. We can write this inflow of foreign investment capital as imports (M) minus exports (X). There are also two main sources of demand for financial capital: private sector investment (I) and government borrowing. Government borrowing in any given year is equal to the budget deficit, which we can write as the difference between government spending (G) and net taxes (T). Let’s call this equation 1.\n\\[\\text{Quantity supplied of financial capital} = \\text{Quantity demanded of financial capital}\\]\n\\[\\text{Private savings} + \\text{Inflow of foreign savings} = \\text{Private investment} + \\text{Government budget deficit}\\]\n\\[S + (M – X) = I + (G –T)\\]\nGovernments often spend more than they receive in taxes and, therefore, public savings (T – G) is negative. This causes a need to borrow money in the amount of (G – T) instead of adding to the nation’s savings. If this is the case, we can view governments as demanders of financial capital instead of suppliers. In algebraic terms, we can rewrite the national savings and investment identity like this:\n\\[\\text{Private investment} = \\text{Private savings} + \\text{Public savings} +\\text{Trade deficit}\\]\n\\[I = S + (T – G) + (M – X)\\]\nLet’s call this equation 2. We must accompany a change in any part of the national saving and investment identity by offsetting changes in at least one other part of the equation because we assume that the equality of quantity supplied and quantity demanded always holds. If the government budget deficit changes, then either private saving or investment or the trade balance—or some combination of the three—must change as well. Figure 12.16 shows the possible effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.16: Effects of Change in Budget Surplus or Deficit on Investment, Savings, and The Trade Balance. Chart (a) shows the potential results when the budget deficit rises (or budget surplus falls). Chart (b) shows the potential results when the budget deficit falls (or budget surplus rises).\n\n\n\nFollowing from the national savings and investment identity, charts (a) and (b) show what happens to investment, private savings, and the trade deficit when the budget deficit rises (or the budget surplus falls). (a) If the budget deficit rises (or the government budget surplus falls), the results could be (1) domestic private investment falls or (2) private savings rise or (3) the trade deficit increases (or a trade surplus diminishes). The opposite results of each are achieved when the budget deficit falls (or the budget surplus rises) as shown in image (b).\n\n\n12.9.2 What about Budget Surpluses and Trade Surpluses?\nThe national saving and investment identity must always hold true because, by definition, the quantity supplied and quantity demanded in the financial capital market must always be equal. However, the formula will look somewhat different if the government budget is in deficit rather than surplus or if the balance of trade is in surplus rather than deficit. For example, in 1999 and 2000, the U.S. government had budget surpluses, although the economy was still experiencing trade deficits. When the government was running budget surpluses, it was acting as a saver rather than a borrower, and supplying rather than demanding financial capital. As a result, we would write the national saving and investment identity during this time as:\n\nQuantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of financial capital\n\n\nPrivate savings + Trade deficit + Government surplus = Private investment\n\n\\[S + (M – X) + (T – G)=I\\]\nLet's call this equation 3. Notice that this expression is mathematically the same as equation 2 except the savings and investment sides of the identity have simply flipped sides.\nDuring the 1960s, the U.S. government was often running a budget deficit, but the economy was typically running trade surpluses. Since a trade surplus means that an economy is experiencing a net outflow of financial capital, we would write the national saving and investment identity as:\n\nQuantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of financial capital\n\n\nPrivate savings = Private investment + Outflow of foreign savings + Government budget deficit\n\nOr using our math notation this reads:\n\\[S=I + (X – M) + (G – T)\\]\nInstead of the balance of trade representing part of the supply of financial capital, which occurs with a trade deficit, a trade surplus represents an outflow of financial capital leaving the domestic economy and invested elsewhere in the world.\n\nQuantity supplied of financial capital = Quantity demanded of financial capital demand\n\n\nPrivate savings = Private investment + Government budget deficit + Trade surplus\n\nUsing the math notation again, we have:\n\\[S=I + (G – T) + (X – M)\\]\nWe assume that the point to these equations is that the national saving and investment identity always hold. When you write these relationships, it is important to engage your brain and think about what is on the supply and demand side of the financial capital market before you start your calculations.\nAs you can see in Figure 12.17, the Office of Management and Budget shows that the United States has consistently run budget deficits since 1977, with the exception of 1999 and 2000. What is alarming is the dramatic increase in budget deficits that has occurred since 2008, which in part reflects declining tax revenues and increased safety net expenditures due to the Great Recession. (Recall that T is net taxes. When the government must transfer funds back to individuals for safety net expenditures like Social Security and unemployment benefits, budget deficits rise.) These deficits have implications for the future health of the U.S. economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.17: United States On-Budget, Surplus, and Deficit, 1977–2014 ($ millions). The United States has run a budget deficit for over 30 years, with the exception of 1999 and 2000. Military expenditures, entitlement programs, and the decrease in tax revenue coupled with increased safety net support during the Great Recession are major contributors to the dramatic increases in the deficit after 2008. (Source: Table 1.1, \"Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits,\" https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows U.S. government budgets and surpluses from 1977 to 2014. The United States has only had two years without a government budget deficit. In the 1980s the deficit hovered above –$200 million, gradually becoming a surplus by the end of 1990s. From 2000 onward, the deficit grew rapidly to –$600 million. The deficit was at its worst in 2009, at close to $1.6 trillion, following the Great Recession. In 2014, it was around –$514 million.\nA rising budget deficit may result in a fall in domestic investment, a rise in private savings, or a rise in the trade deficit. The following modules discuss each of these possible effects in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nA change in any part of the national saving and investment identity suggests that if the government budget deficit changes, then either private savings, private investment in physical capital, or the trade balance—or some combination of the three—must change as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a country, private savings equals 600, the government budget surplus equals 200, and the trade surplus equals 100. What is the level of private investment in this economy?\nAssume an economy has a budget surplus of 1,000, private savings of 4,000, and investment of 5,000.\nWrite out a national saving and investment identity for this economy.\nWhat will be the balance of trade in this economy?\nIf the budget surplus changes to a budget deficit of 1000, with private saving and investment unchanged, what is the new balance of trade in this economy?\nBased on the national saving and investment identity, what are the three ways the macroeconomy might react to greater government budget deficits?\nHow would you expect larger budget deficits to affect private sector investment in physical capital? Why?\nAssume there is no discretionary increase in government spending. Explain how an improving economy will affect the budget balance and, in turn, investment and the trade balance.\nExplain how decreased domestic investments that occur due to a budget deficit will affect future economic growth.\nThe U.S. government has shut down a number of times in recent history. Explain how a government shutdown will affect the variables in the national investment and savings identity. Could the shutdown affect the government budget deficit?",

As The Keynesian Perspective chapter discusses, a net inflow of foreign financial investment always accompanies a trade deficit, while a net outflow of financial investment always accompanies a trade surplus. One way to understand the connection from budget deficits to trade deficits is that when government creates a budget deficit with some combination of tax cuts or spending increases, it will increase aggregate demand in the economy, and some of that increase in aggregate demand will result in a higher level of imports. A higher level of imports, with exports remaining fixed, will cause a larger trade deficit. That means foreigners’ holdings of dollars increase as Americans purchase more imported goods. Foreigners use those dollars to invest in the United States, which leads to an inflow of foreign investment. One possible source of funding our budget deficit is foreigners buying Treasury securities that the U.S. government sells, thus a trade deficit often accompanies a budget deficit.\n\n12.10.1 Twin Deficits?\nIn the mid-1980s, it was common to hear economists and even newspaper articles refer to the twin deficits, as the budget deficit and trade deficit both grew substantially. Figure 12.18 shows the pattern. The federal budget deficit went from 2.6% of GDP in 1981 to 5.1% of GDP in 1985—a drop of 2.5% of GDP. Over that time, the trade deficit moved from 0.5% in 1981 to 2.9% in 1985—a drop of 2.4% of GDP. In the mid-1980s an inflow of foreign investment capital matched, the considerable increase in government borrowing, so the government budget deficit and the trade deficit moved together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.18: U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade Deficits. In the 1980s, the budget deficit and the trade deficit declined at the same time. However, since then, the deficits have stopped being twins. The trade deficit grew smaller in the early 1990s as the budget deficit increased, and then the trade deficit grew larger in the late 1990s as the budget deficit turned into a surplus. In the first half of the 2000s, both budget and trade deficits increased. However, in 2009, the trade deficit declined as the budget deficit increased.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows little relation between the rising (getting larger) and falling of the budget deficit and trade deficit since the 1980s.\nOf course, no one should expect the budget deficit and trade deficit to move in lockstep, because the other parts of the national saving and investment identity—investment and private savings—will often change as well. In the late 1990s, for example, the government budget balance turned from deficit to surplus, but the trade deficit remained large and growing. During this time, the inflow of foreign financial investment was supporting a surge of physical capital investment by U.S. firms. In the first half of the 2000s, the budget and trade deficits again increased together, but in 2009, the budget deficit increased while the trade deficit declined. The budget deficit and the trade deficits are related to each other, but they are more like cousins than twins.\n\n\n12.10.2 Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates\nExchange rates can also help to explain why budget deficits are linked to trade deficits. Figure 12.19 shows a situation using the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar, measured in euros. At the original equilibrium (E0), where the demand for U.S. dollars (D0) intersects with the supply of U.S. dollars (S0) on the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate is 0.9 euros per U.S. dollar and the equilibrium quantity traded in the market is $100 billion per day (which was roughly the quantity of dollar–euro trading in exchange rate markets in the mid-2000s). Then the U.S. budget deficit rises and foreign financial investment provides the source of funds for that budget deficit.\nInternational financial investors, as a group, will demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets to purchase the U.S. government bonds, and they will supply fewer of the U.S. dollars that they already hold in these markets. Demand for U.S. dollars on the foreign exchange market shifts from D0 to D1 and the supply of U.S. dollars falls from S0 to S1. At the new equilibrium (E1), the exchange rate has appreciated to 1.05 euros per dollar while, in this example, the quantity of dollars traded remains the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.19: Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates. Imagine that the U.S. government increases its borrowing and the funds come from European financial investors. To purchase U.S. government bonds, those European investors will need to demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets, causing the demand for U.S. dollars to shift to the right from D0 to D1. European financial investors as a group will also be less likely to supply U.S. dollars to the foreign exchange markets, causing the supply of U.S. dollars to shift from S0 to S1. The equilibrium exchange rate strengthens from 0.9 euro/ dollar at E0 to 1.05 euros/dollar at E1.\n\n\n\nThis graph shows the demand and supply of foreign currency. The y-axis shows the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate and the x-axis shows the quantity of dollars traded. As explained in the text, a budget deficit raises the demand for dollars (and lowers the supply of dollars) because foreign investors want to purchase U.S. government debt. The result is a stronger exchange rate.\nA stronger exchange rate, of course, makes it more difficult for exporters to sell their goods abroad while making imports cheaper, so a trade deficit (or a reduced trade surplus) results. Thus, a budget deficit can easily result in an inflow of foreign financial capital, a stronger exchange rate, and a trade deficit.\nYou can also imagine interest rates are driving the exchange rate appreciation. As we explained earlier in [link], a budget deficit increases demand in markets for domestic financial capital, raising the domestic interest rate. A higher interest rate will attract an inflow of foreign financial capital, and appreciate the exchange rate in response to the increase in demand for U.S. dollars by foreign investors and a decrease in supply of U. S. dollars. Because of higher interest rates in the United States, Americans find U.S. bonds more attractive than foreign bonds. When Americans are buying fewer foreign bonds, they are supplying fewer U.S. dollars. U.S. dollar depreciation leads to a larger trade deficit (or reduced surplus). The connections between inflows of foreign investment capital, interest rates, and exchange rates are all just different ways of drawing the same economic connections: a larger budget deficit can result in a larger trade deficit, although do not expect the connection to be one-to-one.\n\n\n12.10.3 From Budget Deficits to International Economic Crisis\nWe lay out step-by-step the economic story of how an outflow of international financial capital can cause a deep recession in the Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows chapter. When international financial investors decide to withdraw their funds from a country like Turkey, they increase the supply of the Turkish lira and reduce the demand for lira, depreciating the lira exchange rate. When firms and the government in a country like Turkey borrow money in international financial markets, they typically do so in stages. First, banks in Turkey borrow in a widely used currency like U.S. dollars or euros, then convert those U.S. dollars to lira, and then lend the money to borrowers in Turkey. If the lira's exchange rate value depreciates, then Turkey’s banks will find it impossible to repay the international loans that are in U.S. dollars or euros.\nThe combination of less foreign investment capital and banks that are bankrupt can sharply reduce aggregate demand, which causes a deep recession. Many countries around the world have experienced this kind of recession in recent years: along with Turkey in 2002, Mexico followed this general pattern in 1995, Thailand and countries across East Asia in 1997–1998, Russia in 1998, and Argentina in 2002. In many of these countries, large government budget deficits played a role in setting the stage for the financial crisis. A moderate increase in a budget deficit that leads to a moderate increase in a trade deficit and a moderate appreciation of the exchange rate is not necessarily a cause for concern. However, beyond some point that is hard to define in advance, a series of large budget deficits can become a cause for concern among international investors.\nOne reason for concern is that extremely large budget deficits mean that aggregate demand may shift so far to the right as to cause high inflation. The example of Turkey is a situation where very large budget deficits brought inflation rates well into double digits. In addition, very large budget deficits at some point begin to raise a fear that the government would not repay the borrowing. In the last 175 years, the government of Turkey has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans six times. Brazil’s government has been unable to pay its debts and defaulted on its loans seven times; Venezuela, nine times; and Argentina, five times. The risk of high inflation or a default on repaying international loans will worry international investors, since both factors imply that the rate of return on their investments in that country may end up lower than expected. If international investors start withdrawing the funds from a country rapidly, the scenario of less investment, a depreciated exchange rate, widespread bank failure, and deep recession can occur. The following Clear It Up feature explains other impacts of large deficits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF CHRONIC LARGE DEFICITS IN THE UNITED STATES?\nIf a government runs large budget deficits for a sustained period of time, what can go wrong? According to a recent Brookings Institution report, a key risk of a large budget deficit is that government debt may grow too high compared to the country’s GDP growth. As debt grows, the national savings rate will decline, leaving less available in financial capital for private investment. The impact of chronically large budget deficits is as follows:\n\n\nAs the population ages, there will be an increasing demand for government services that may cause higher government deficits. Government borrowing and its interest payments will pull resources away from domestic investment in human capital and physical capital that is essential to economic growth.\nInterest rates may start to rise so that the cost of financing government debt will rise as well, creating pressure on the government to reduce its budget deficits through spending cuts and tax increases. These steps will be politically painful, and they will also have a contractionary effect on aggregate demand in the economy.\nRising percentage of debt to GDP will create uncertainty in the financial and global markets that might cause a country to resort to inflationary tactics to reduce the real value of the debt outstanding. This will decrease real wealth and damage confidence in the country’s ability to manage its spending. After all, if the government has borrowed at a fixed interest rate of, say, 5%, and it lets inflation rise above that 5%, then it will effectively be able to repay its debt at a negative real interest rate.\n\n\nThe conventional reasoning suggests that the relationship between sustained deficits that lead to high levels of government debt and long-term growth is negative. How significant this relationship is, how big an issue it is compared to other macroeconomic issues, and the direction of causality, is less clear.\nWhat remains important to acknowledge is that the relationship between debt and growth is negative and that for some countries, the relationship may be stronger than in others. It is also important to acknowledge the direction of causality: does high debt cause slow growth, slow growth cause high debt, or are both high debt and slow growth the result of third factors? In our analysis, we have argued simply that high debt causes slow growth. There may be more to this debate than we have space to discuss here.\n\n\n\n\n12.10.4 Using Fiscal Policy to Address Trade Imbalances\nIf a nation is experiencing the inflow of foreign investment capital associated with a trade deficit because foreign investors are making long-term direct investments in firms, there may be no substantial reason for concern. After all, many low-income nations around the world would welcome direct investment by multinational firms that ties them more closely into the global networks of production and distribution of goods and services. In this case, the inflows of foreign investment capital and the trade deficit are attracted by the opportunities for a good rate of return on private sector investment in an economy.\nHowever, governments should beware of a sustained pattern of high budget deficits and high trade deficits. The danger arises in particular when the inflow of foreign investment capital is not funding long-term physical capital investment by firms, but instead is short-term portfolio investment in government bonds. When inflows of foreign financial investment reach high levels, foreign financial investors will be on the alert for any reason to fear that the country’s exchange rate may decline or the government may be unable to repay what it has borrowed on time. Just as a few falling rocks can trigger an avalanche; a relatively small piece of bad news about an economy can trigger an enormous outflow of short-term financial capital.\nReducing a nation’s budget deficit will not always be a successful method of reducing its trade deficit, because other elements of the national saving and investment identity, like private saving or investment, may change instead. In those cases when the budget deficit is the main cause of the trade deficit, governments should take steps to reduce their budget deficits, lest they make their economy vulnerable to a rapid outflow of international financial capital that could bring a deep recession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFINANCING HIGHER EDUCATION\nBetween 1982 and 2012, the increases in the cost of a college education had far outpaced that of the income of the typical American family. According to President Obama’s research staff, the cost of education at a four-year public college increased by 257% compared to an increase in family incomes of only 16% over the prior 30 years. The ongoing debate over a balanced budget and proposed cutbacks accentuated the need to increase investment in human capital to grow the economy versus deepening the already significant debt levels of the U.S. government.\nIn summer 2013, President Obama presented a plan to make college more affordable that included increasing Pell Grant awards and the number of recipients, caps on interest rates for student loans, and providing education tax credits. In addition, the plan includes an accountability method for institutions of higher education that focuses on completion rates and creates a College Scorecard. Whether or not all these initiatives come to fruition remains to be seen, but they are indicative of creative approaches that government can take to meet its obligation from both a public and fiscal policy perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe government need not balance its budget every year.\nHowever, a sustained pattern of large budget deficits over time risks causing several negative macroeconomic outcomes: a shift to the right in aggregate demand that causes an inflationary increase in the price level; crowding out private investment in physical capital in a way that slows down economic growth; and creating a dependence on inflows of international portfolio investment which can sometimes turn into outflows of foreign financial investment that can be injurious to a macroeconomy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the late 1990s, the U.S. government moved from a budget deficit to a budget surplus and the trade deficit in the U.S. economy grew substantially. Using the national saving and investment identity, what can you say about the direction in which saving and/or investment must have changed in this economy?\nUnder what conditions will a larger budget deficit cause a trade deficit?\nExplain how a shift from a government budget deficit to a budget surplus might affect the exchange rate.\nDescribe how a plan for reducing the government deficit might affect a college student, a young professional, and a middle-income family.",

    "text": "12.11 How Government Borrowing Affects Private Saving\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nApply Ricardian equivalence to evaluate how government borrowing affects private saving\nInterpret a graphic representation of Ricardian equivalence\n\n\n\nA change in government budgets may impact private saving. Imagine that people watch government budgets and adjust their savings accordingly. For example, whenever the government runs a budget deficit, people might reason: “Well, a higher budget deficit means that I’m just going to owe more taxes in the future to pay off all that government borrowing, so I’ll start saving now.” If the government runs budget surpluses, people might reason: “With these budget surpluses (or lower budget deficits), interest rates are falling, so that saving is less attractive. Moreover, with a budget surplus the country will be able to afford a tax cut sometime in the future. I won’t bother saving as much now.”\nThe theory that rational private households might shift their saving to offset government saving or borrowing is known as Ricardian equivalence because the idea has intellectual roots in the writings of the early nineteenth-century economist David Ricardo (1772–1823). If Ricardian equivalence holds completely true, then in the national saving and investment identity, any change in budget deficits or budget surpluses would be completely offset by a corresponding change in private saving. As a result, changes in government borrowing would have no effect at all on either physical capital investment or trade balances.\nIn practice, the private sector only sometimes and partially adjusts its savings behavior to offset government budget deficits and surpluses. Figure 12.20 shows the patterns of U.S. government budget deficits and surpluses and the rate of private saving—which includes saving by both households and firms—since 1980. The connection between the two is not at all obvious.\nIn the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits were quite large, but there is no corresponding surge of private saving. However, when budget deficits turn to surpluses in the late 1990s, there is a simultaneous decline in private saving. When budget deficits get very large in 2008 and 2009, there is some sign of a rise in saving. A variety of statistical studies based on the U.S. experience suggests that when government borrowing increases by $1, private saving rises by about 30 cents. A World Bank study from the late 1990s, looking at government budgets and private saving behavior in countries around the world, found a similar result.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.20: U.S. Budget Deficits and Private Savings. The theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests that additional private saving will offset any increase in government borrowing, while reduced private saving will offset any decrease in government borrowing. Sometimes this theory holds true, and sometimes it does not. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Federal Reserve Economic Data)\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that government borrowing and private investment sometimes rise and fall together. For example, between 1980 and 1984 the deficit as a percentage of GDP fell from –5 to –2% and the gross private savings as a percentage of GDP also fell from 22% to 20%. In 2014, the gross private savings as around 20%, and the budget deficit/surplus was closer to –3%.\nPrivate saving does increase to some extent when governments run large budget deficits, and private saving falls when governments reduce deficits or run large budget surpluses. However, the offsetting effects of private saving compared to government borrowing are much less than one-to-one. In addition, this effect can vary a great deal from country to country, from time to time, and over the short and the long run.\nIf the funding for a larger budget deficit comes from international financial investors, then a trade deficit may accompany a budget deficit. In some countries, this pattern of twin deficits has set the stage for international financial investors first to send their funds to a country and cause an appreciation of its exchange rate and then to pull their funds out and cause a depreciation of the exchange rate and a financial crisis as well. It depends on whether funding comes from international financial investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe theory of Ricardian equivalence holds that changes in private saving will offset changes in government borrowing or saving.\nThus, greater private saving will offset higher budget deficits, while greater private borrowing will offset larger budget surpluses.\nIf the theory holds true, then changes in government borrowing or saving would have no effect on private investment in physical capital or on the trade balance.\nHowever, empirical evidence suggests that the theory holds true only partially.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine an economy in which Ricardian equivalence holds. This economy has a budget deficit of 50, a trade deficit of 20, private savings of 130, and investment of 100. If the budget deficit rises to 70, how are the other terms in the national saving and investment identity affected?\nWhat is the theory of Ricardian equivalence?\nWhat does the concept of rationality have to do with Ricardian equivalence?\nExplain whether or not you agree with the premise of the Ricardian equivalence theory that rational people might reason: “Well, a higher budget deficit (surplus) means that I’m just going to owe more (less) taxes in the future to pay off all that government borrowing, so I’ll start saving (spending) now.” Why or why not?",

    "text": "12.12 Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain crowding out and its effect on physical capital investment\nExplain the relationship between budget deficits and interest rates\nIdentify why economic growth is tied to investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology\n\n\n\nThe underpinnings of economic growth are investments in physical capital, human capital, and technology, all set in an economic environment where firms and individuals can react to the incentives provided by well-functioning markets and flexible prices. Government borrowing can reduce the financial capital available for private firms to invest in physical capital. However, government spending can also encourage certain elements of long-term growth, such as spending on roads or water systems, on education, or on research and development that creates new technology.\n\n12.12.1 Crowding Out Physical Capital Investment\nA larger budget deficit will increase demand for financial capital. If private saving and the trade balance remain the same, then less financial capital will be available for private investment in physical capital. When government borrowing soaks up available financial capital and leaves less for private investment in physical capital, economists call the result crowding out.\nTo understand the potential impact of crowding out, consider the U.S. economy's situation before the exceptional circumstances of the recession that started in late 2007. In 2005, for example, the budget deficit was roughly 4% of GDP. Private investment by firms in the U.S. economy has hovered in the range of 14% to 18% of GDP in recent decades. However, in any given year, roughly half of U.S. investment in physical capital just replaces machinery and equipment that has worn out or become technologically obsolete. Only about half represents an increase in the total quantity of physical capital in the economy. Investment in new physical capital in any year is about 7% to 9% of GDP. In this situation, even U.S. budget deficits in the range of 4% of GDP can potentially crowd out a substantial share of new investment spending. Conversely, a smaller budget deficit (or an increased budget surplus) increases the pool of financial capital available for private investment.\nFigure 12.21 shows the patterns of U.S. budget deficits and private investment since 1980. If greater government deficits lead to less private investment in physical capital, and reduced government deficits or budget surpluses lead to more investment in physical capital, these two lines should move up and down simultaneously. This pattern occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\nThe U.S. federal budget went from a deficit of 2.2% of GDP in 1995 to a budget surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2000—a swing of 4.6% of GDP. From 1995 to 2000, private investment in physical capital rose from 15% to 18% of GDP—a rise of 3% of GDP. Then, when the U.S. government again started running budget deficits in the early 2000s, less financial capital became available for private investment, and the rate of private investment fell back to about 15% of GDP by 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.21: U.S. Budget Deficits/Surpluses and Private Investment. The connection between private savings and flows of international capital plays a role in budget deficits and surpluses. Consequently, government borrowing and private investment sometimes rise and fall together. For example, the 1990s show a pattern in which reduced government borrowing helped to reduce crowding out so that more funds were available for private investment.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows that in the case of the United States, since 1980 government borrowing and private investment have often risen and fallen in tandem. The y-axis shows U.S. government deficits/surpluses and private investment as a portion of GDP. The x-axis plots years from 1980 to 2014. It suggests that reduced government borrowing can free up capital for private investment.\nThis argument does not claim that a government's budget deficits will exactly shadow its national rate of private investment; after all, we must account for private saving and inflows of foreign financial investment. In the mid-1980s, for example, government budget deficits increased substantially without a corresponding drop off in private investment. In 2009, nonresidential private fixed investment dropped by $300 billion from its previous level of $1,941 billion in 2008, primarily because, during a recession, firms lack both the funds and the incentive to invest. Investment growth between 2009 and 2014 averaged approximately 5.9% to $2,210.5 billion—only slightly above its 2008 level, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. During that same period, interest rates dropped from 3.94% to less than a quarter percent as the Federal Reserve took dramatic action to prevent a depression by increasing the money supply through lowering short-term interest rates. The \"crowding out\" of private investment due to government borrowing to finance expenditures appears to have been suspended during the Great Recession. However, as the economy improves and interest rates rise, government borrowing may potentially create pressure on interest rates.\n\n\n12.12.2 The Interest Rate Connection\nAssume that government borrowing of substantial amounts will have an effect on the quantity of private investment. How will this affect interest rates in financial markets? In Figure 12.22, the original equilibrium (E0) where the demand curve (D0) for financial capital intersects with the supply curve (S0) occurs at an interest rate of 5% and an equilibrium quantity equal to 20% of GDP. However, as the government budget deficit increases, the demand curve for financial capital shifts from D0 to D1. The new equilibrium (E1) occurs at an interest rate of 6% and an equilibrium quantity of 21% of GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.22: Budget Deficits and Interest Rates. In the financial market, an increase in government borrowing can shift the demand curve for financial capital to the right from D0 to D1. As the equilibrium interest rate shifts from E0 to E1, the interest rate rises from 5% to 6% in this example. The higher interest rate is one economic mechanism by which government borrowing can crowd out private investment.\n\n\n\nThe graph plots the downward-sloping demand and upward-sloping supply of financial capital. The y-axis is the interest rate (also known as the “price” of financial capital) and the x-axis shows the quantity of financial capital as a percentage of GDP. An increase in government borrowing increases the quantity of financial capital demanded at all interest rates. This is a rightward shift in the demand for financial capital. The graph shows that the equilibrium interest rate will rise.\nA survey of economic studies on the connection between government borrowing and interest rates in the U.S. economy suggests that an increase of 1% in the budget deficit will lead to a rise in interest rates of between 0.5 and 1.0%, other factors held equal. In turn, a higher interest rate tends to discourage firms from making physical capital investments. One reason government budget deficits crowd out private investment, therefore, is the increase in interest rates. There are, however, economic studies that show a limited connection between the two (at least in the United States), but as the budget deficit grows, the dangers of rising interest rates become more real.\nAt this point, you may wonder about the Federal Reserve. After all, can the Federal Reserve not use expansionary monetary policy to reduce interest rates, or in this case, to prevent interest rates from rising? This useful question emphasizes the importance of considering how fiscal and monetary policies work in relation to each other. Imagine a central bank faced with a government that is running large budget deficits, causing a rise in interest rates and crowding out private investment. If the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is already producing near potential GDP, threatening an inflationary increase in price levels, the central bank may react with a contractionary monetary policy. In this situation, the higher interest rates from the government borrowing would be made even higher by contractionary monetary policy, and the government borrowing might crowd out a great deal of private investment.\nAlternatively, if the budget deficits are increasing aggregate demand when the economy is producing substantially less than potential GDP, an inflationary increase in the price level is not much of a danger and the central bank might react with expansionary monetary policy. In this situation, higher interest rates from government borrowing would be largely offset by lower interest rates from expansionary monetary policy, and there would be little crowding out of private investment.\nHowever, even a central bank cannot erase the overall message of the national savings and investment identity. If government borrowing rises, then private investment must fall, or private saving must rise, or the trade deficit must fall. By reacting with contractionary or expansionary monetary policy, the central bank can only help to determine which of these outcomes is likely.\n\n\n12.12.3 Public Investment in Physical Capital\nGovernment can invest in physical capital directly: roads and bridges; water supply and sewers; seaports and airports; schools and hospitals; plants that generate electricity, like hydroelectric dams or windmills; telecommunications facilities; and military weapons. In 2014, the U.S. federal government budget for Fiscal Year 2014 shows that the United States spent about $92 billion on transportation, including highways, mass transit, and airports.\nTable 12.1 shows the federal government's total outlay for 2014 for major public physical capital investment in the United States. We have omitted physical capital related to the military or to residences where people live from this table, because the focus here is on public investments that have a direct effect on raising output in the private sector.\n\n\n\nTable 12.1: Grants for Major Physical Capital Investment, 2014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType of Public Physical Capital\nFederal Outlays 2014 ($ millions)\n\n\n\n\nTransportation\n$91,915\n\n\nCommunity and regional development\n$20,670\n\n\nNatural resources and the environment\n$36,171\n\n\nEducation, training, employment, and social services\n$90,615\n\n\nOther\n$37,282\n\n\nTotal\n$276,653\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic physical capital investment of this sort can increase the economy's output and productivity. An economy with reliable roads and electricity will be able to produce more. However, it is hard to quantify how much government investment in physical capital will benefit the economy, because government responds to political as well as economic incentives. When a firm makes an investment in physical capital, it is subject to the discipline of the market: If it does not receive a positive return on investment, the firm may lose money or even go out of business.\nIn some cases, lawmakers make investments in physical capital as a way of spending money in key politicians' districts. The result may be unnecessary roads or office buildings. Even if a project is useful and necessary, it might be done in a way that is excessively costly, because local contractors who make campaign contributions to politicians appreciate the extra business. Alternatively, governments sometimes do not make the investments they should because a decision to spend on infrastructure does not need to just make economic sense. It must be politically popular as well. Managing public investment cost-effectively can be difficult.\nIf a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital with higher taxes or lower government spending in other areas, it need not worry that it is directly crowding out private investment. Indirectly however, higher household taxes could cut down on the level of private savings available and have a similar effect. If a government decides to finance an investment in public physical capital by borrowing, it may end up increasing the quantity of public physical capital at the cost of crowding out investment in private physical capital, which could be more beneficial to the economy.\n\n\n12.12.4 Public Investment in Human Capital\nIn most countries, the government plays a large role in society's investment in human capital through the education system. A highly educated and skilled workforce contributes to a higher rate of economic growth. For the low-income nations of the world, additional investment in human capital seems likely to increase productivity and growth. For the United States, critics have raised tough questions about how much increases in government spending on education will improve the actual level of education.\nAmong economists, discussions of education reform often begin with some uncomfortable facts. As Figure 12.23 shows, spending per student for kindergarten through grade 12 (K–12) increased substantially in real dollars through 2010. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that current spending per pupil for elementary and secondary education rose from $5,001 in 1998 to $10,608 in 2012. However, as measured by standardized tests like the SAT, the level of student academic achievement has barely budged in recent decades. On international tests, U.S. students lag behind students from many other countries. (Of course, test scores are an imperfect measure of education for a variety of reasons. It would be difficult, however, to argue that there are not real problems in the U.S. education system and that the tests are just inaccurate.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.23: Total Spending for Elementary, Secondary, and Vocational Education (1998–2014) in the United States. The graph shows that government spending on education was continually increasing up until 2006 where it leveled off until 2008 when it increased dramatically. Since 2010, spending has steadily decreased. (Source: Office of Management and Budget)\n\n\n\nThe line graph shows that government spending on education has continually increased from 1998 up until 2006, where it leveled off. In 2008, it increased dramatically from $35 to over $70 million. Since 2010, spending has steadily decreased to a little over $40 million in 2014.\nThe fact that increased financial resources have not brought greater measurable gains in student performance has led some education experts to question whether the problems may be due to structure, not just to the resources spent.\nOther government programs seek to increase human capital either before or after the K–12 education system. Programs for early childhood education, like the federal Head Start program, are directed at families where the parents may have limited educational and financial resources. Government also offers substantial support for universities and colleges. For example, in the United States about 60% of students take at least a few college or university classes beyond the high school level. In Germany and Japan, about half of all students take classes beyond the comparable high school level. In the countries of Latin America, only about one student in four takes classes beyond the high school level, and in the nations of sub-Saharan Africa, only about one student in 20.\nNot all spending on educational human capital needs to happen through the government: many college students in the United States pay a substantial share of the cost of their education. If low-income countries of the world are going to experience a widespread increase in their education levels for grade-school children, government spending seems likely to play a substantial role. For the U.S. economy, and for other high-income countries, the primary focus at this time is more on how to get a bigger return from existing spending on education and how to improve the performance of the average high school graduate, rather than dramatic increases in education spending.\n\n\n12.12.5 How Fiscal Policy Can Improve Technology\nResearch and development (R&D) efforts are the lifeblood of new technology. According to the National Science Foundation, federal outlays for research, development, and physical plant improvements to various governmental agencies have remained at an average of 8.8% of GDP. About one-fifth of U.S. R&D spending goes to defense and space-oriented research. Although defense-oriented R&D spending may sometimes produce consumer-oriented spinoffs, R&D that is aimed at producing new weapons is less likely to benefit the civilian economy than direct civilian R&D spending.\nFiscal policy can encourage R&D using either direct spending or tax policy. Government could spend more on the R&D that it carries out in government laboratories, as well as expanding federal R&D grants to universities and colleges, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector. By 2014, the federal share of R&D outlays totaled $135.5 billion, or about 4% of the federal government's total budget outlays, according to data from the National Science Foundation. Fiscal policy can also support R&D through tax incentives, which allow firms to reduce their tax bill as they increase spending on research and development.\n\n\n12.12.6 Summary of Fiscal Policy, Investment, and Economic Growth\nInvestment in physical capital, human capital, and new technology is essential for long-term economic growth, as Table 12.2 summarizes. In a market-oriented economy, private firms will undertake most of the investment in physical capital, and fiscal policy should seek to avoid a long series of outsized budget deficits that might crowd out such investment.\nWe will see the effects of many growth-oriented policies very gradually over time, as students are better educated, we make physical capital investments, and man invents and implements new technologies.\n\n\n\nTable 12.2: Investment Role of Public and Private Sector in a Market Economy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSector\nPhysical Capital\nHuman Capital\nNew Technology\n\n\n\n\nPrivate Sector\nNew investment in property and equipment\nOn-the-job training training\nResearch and development development\n\n\nPublic Sector\nPublic infrastructure\nPublic education Job training\nResearch and development encouraged through private sector incentives and direct spending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nEconomic growth comes from a combination of investment in physical capital, human capital, and technology.\nGovernment borrowing can crowd out private sector investment in physical capital, but fiscal policy can also increase investment in publicly owned physical capital, human capital (education), and research and development.\nPossible methods for improving education and society’s investment in human capital include spending more money on teachers and other educational resources, and reorganizing the education system to provide greater incentives for success.\nMethods for increasing research and development spending to generate new technology include direct government spending on R&D and tax incentives for businesses to conduct additional R&D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy have many education experts recently placed an emphasis on altering the incentives that U.S. schools face rather than on increasing their budgets? Without endorsing any of these proposals as especially good or bad, list some of the ways in which incentives for schools might be altered.\nWhat are some steps the government can take to encourage research and development?\nWhat are some of the ways fiscal policy might encourage economic growth?\nWhat are some fiscal policies for improving a society’s human capital?\nWhat are some fiscal policies for improving the technologies that the economy will have to draw upon in the future?\nExplain how cuts in funding for programs such as Head Start might affect the development of human capital in the United States.\nExplain why the government might prefer to provide incentives to private firms to do investment or research and development, rather than simply doing the spending itself?\nUnder what condition would crowding out not inhibit long-run economic growth? Under what condition would crowding out impede long-run economic growth?\nWhat must take place for the government to run deficits without any crowding out?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Yellowstone National Park is one of the many national parks forced to close down during the government shut down in October 2013.

Since 1960, total federal spending has ranged from about 18% to 22% of GDP, although it climbed above that level in 2009, but quickly dropped back down to that level by 2013. The share that the government has spent on national defense has generally declined, while the share it has spent on Social Security and on healthcare expenses (mainly Medicare and Medicaid) has increased.

About 73% of government spending goes to four major areas: national defense, Social Security, healthcare, and interest payments on past borrowing.

Spending by state and local government increased from about 10% of GDP in the early 1960s to 14–16% by the mid-1970s. It has remained at roughly that level since. The single biggest spending item is education, including both K–12 spending and support for public colleges and universities, which has been about 4–5% of GDP in recent decades.

The primary sources of federal taxes are individual income taxes and the payroll taxes that finance Social Security and Medicare. Corporate income taxes and social insurance taxes provide smaller shares of revenue. (Source: Economic Report of the President, 2015.

The federal government has run budget deficits for decades. The budget was briefly in surplus in the late 1990s, before heading into deficit again in the first decade of the 2000s—and especially deep deficits in the 2008-2009 recession. (Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED). http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FYFSGDA188S)\nFigure 12.8: Federal Debt as a Percentage of GDP, 1942–2014. Federal debt is the sum of annual budget deficits and surpluses. Annual deficits do not always mean that the debt/GDP ratio is rising. During the 1960s and 1970s, the government often ran small deficits, but since the debt was growing more slowly than the economy, the debt/GDP ratio was declining over this time. In the 2008–2009 recession, the debt/GDP ratio rose sharply. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Table B-20, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2015/content-detail.html)\nFigure 12.9: Total Government Spending and Taxes as a Share of GDP, 1990–2014. When government spending exceeds taxes, the gap is the budget deficit. When taxes exceed spending, the gap is a budget surplus. The recessionary period starting in late 2007 saw higher spending and lower taxes, combining to create a large deficit in 2009. (Source: Economic Report of the President, Tables B-21 and B-1,\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2015/content-detail.html)\nFigure 12.10: In this well-functioning economy, each year aggregate supply and aggregate demand shift to the right so that the economy proceeds from equilibrium E0 to E1 to E2. Each year, the economy produces at potential GDP with only a small inflationary increase in the price level. However, if aggregate demand does not smoothly shift to the right and match increases in aggregate supply, growth with deflation can develop.\nFigure 12.11: Expansionary Fiscal Policy. The original equilibrium (E0) represents a recession, occurring at a quantity of output (Y0) below potential GDP. However, a shift of aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1, enacted through an expansionary fiscal policy, can move the economy to a new equilibrium output of E1 at the level of potential GDP which the LRAS curve shows. Since the economy was originally producing below potential GDP, any inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1 that results should be relatively small.\nFigure 12.12: A Contractionary Fiscal Policy. The economy starts at the equilibrium quantity of output Y0, which is above potential GDP. The extremely high level of aggregate demand will generate inflationary increases in the price level. A contractionary fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand down from AD0 to AD1, leading to a new equilibrium output E1, which occurs at potential GDP, where AD1 intersects the LRAS curve.\nFigure 12.13: Comparison of Actual Budget Deficits with the Standardized Employment Deficit. When the economy is in recession, the standardized employment budget deficit is less than the actual budget deficit because the economy is below potential GDP, and the automatic stabilizers are reducing taxes and increasing spending. When the economy is performing extremely well, the standardized employment deficit (or surplus) is higher than the actual budget deficit (or surplus) because the economy is producing about potential GDP, so the automatic stabilizers are increasing taxes and reducing the need for government spending. (Sources: Actual and Cyclically Adjusted Budget Surpluses/Deficits, http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43977; and Economic Report of the President, Table B-1, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2013/content-detail.html)\nFigure 12.14: Fiscal Policy and Interest Rates. When a government borrows money in the financial capital market, it causes a shift in the demand for financial capital from D0 to D1. As the equilibrium moves from E0 to E1, the equilibrium interest rate rises from 6% to 7% in this example. In this way, an expansionary fiscal policy intended to shift aggregate demand to the right can also lead to a higher interest rate, which has the effect of shifting aggregate demand back to the left.\nFigure 12.15: President Lyndon Johnson played a pivotal role in financing higher education.

The United States has run a budget deficit for over 30 years, with the exception of 1999 and 2000. Military expenditures, entitlement programs, and the decrease in tax revenue coupled with increased safety net support during the Great Recession are major contributors to the dramatic increases in the deficit after 2008. (Source: Table 1.1, \"Summary of Receipts, Outlays, and Surpluses or Deficits,\" https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Historicals)\nFigure 12.18: U.S. Budget Deficits and Trade Deficits. In the 1980s, the budget deficit and the trade deficit declined at the same time. However, since then, the deficits have stopped being twins. The trade deficit grew smaller in the early 1990s as the budget deficit increased, and then the trade deficit grew larger in the late 1990s as the budget deficit turned into a surplus. In the first half of the 2000s, both budget and trade deficits increased. However, in 2009, the trade deficit declined as the budget deficit increased.\nFigure 12.19: Budget Deficits and Exchange Rates. Imagine that the U.S. government increases its borrowing and the funds come from European financial investors. To purchase U.S. government bonds, those European investors will need to demand more U.S. dollars on foreign exchange markets, causing the demand for U.S. dollars to shift to the right from D0 to D1. European financial investors as a group will also be less likely to supply U.S. dollars to the foreign exchange markets, causing the supply of U.S. dollars to shift from S0 to S1. The equilibrium exchange rate strengthens from 0.9 euro/ dollar at E0 to 1.05 euros/dollar at E1.\nFigure 12.20: U.S. Budget Deficits and Private Savings. The theory of Ricardian equivalence suggests that additional private saving will offset any increase in government borrowing, while reduced private saving will offset any decrease in government borrowing. Sometimes this theory holds true, and sometimes it does not. (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis and Federal Reserve Economic Data)\nFigure 12.21: U.S. Budget Deficits/Surpluses and Private Investment. The connection between private savings and flows of international capital plays a role in budget deficits and surpluses. Consequently, government borrowing and private investment sometimes rise and fall together. For example, the 1990s show a pattern in which reduced government borrowing helped to reduce crowding out so that more funds were available for private investment.\nFigure 12.22: Budget Deficits and Interest Rates.

The sum of all the income received for contributing resources to GDP is called national income (Y).

The aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. A vertical line shows potential GDP where full employment occurs. The 45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output are equal. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real GDP rises. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium. Equilibrium occurs at E0, where aggregate expenditure AE0 is equal to the output level Y0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.1.1 The Potential GDP Line and the 45-degree Line\nThe Keynesian cross diagram contains two lines that serve as conceptual guideposts to orient the discussion. The first is a vertical line showing the level of potential GDP. Potential GDP means the same thing here that it means in the AD/AS diagrams: it refers to the quantity of output that the economy can produce with full employment of its labor and physical capital.\nThe second conceptual line on the Keynesian cross diagram is the 45-degree line, which starts at the origin and reaches up and to the right. A line that stretches up at a 45-degree angle represents the set of points (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3) and so on, where the measurement on the vertical axis is equal to the measurement on the horizontal axis. In this diagram, the 45-degree line shows the set of points where the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy, measured on the vertical axis, is equal to the level of output or national income in the economy, measured by GDP on the horizontal axis.\nWhen the macroeconomy is in equilibrium, it must be true that the aggregate expenditures in the economy are equal to the real GDP—because by definition, GDP is the measure of what is spent on final sales of goods and services in the economy. Thus, the equilibrium calculated with a Keynesian cross diagram will always end up where aggregate expenditure and output are equal—which will only occur along the 45-degree line.\n\n\n13.1.2 The Aggregate Expenditure Schedule\nThe final ingredient of the Keynesian cross or expenditure-output diagram is the aggregate expenditure schedule, which will show the total expenditures in the economy for each level of real GDP. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure line with the 45-degree line—at point E0 in Figure—will show the equilibrium for the economy, because it is the point where aggregate expenditure is equal to output or real GDP. After developing an understanding of what the aggregate expenditures schedule means, we will return to this equilibrium and how to interpret it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe expenditure-output model or Keynesian cross diagram shows how the level of aggregate expenditure (on the vertical axis) varies with the level of economic output (shown on the horizontal axis). Since the value of all macroeconomic output also represents income to someone somewhere else in the economy, the horizontal axis can also be interpreted as national income.\nThe equilibrium in the diagram will occur where the aggregate expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line, which represents the set of points where aggregate expenditure in the economy is equal to output (or national income). Equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram can happen at potential GDP, or below or above that level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is on the axes of an expenditure-output diagram?\nWhat does the 45-degree line show?\nWhat does it mean when the aggregate expenditure line crosses the 45-degree line?

    "text": "13.2 Building the Aggregate Expenditure Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nAggregate Expenditure\nConsumption Function\nInvestment and Government Spending\nExports and Imports\n\n\n\nAggregate expenditure is the key to the expenditure-income model. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows, either in the form of a table or a graph, how aggregate expenditures in the economy rise as real GDP or national income rises. Thus, in thinking about the components of the aggregate expenditure line—consumption, investment, government spending, exports and imports—the key question is how expenditures in each category will adjust as national income rises.\n\n13.2.1 Consumption as a Function of National Income\nHow do consumption expenditures increase as national income rises? People can do two things with their income: consume it or save it (for the moment, let’s ignore the need to pay taxes with some of it). Each person who receives an additional dollar faces this choice. The marginal propensity to consume (MPC), is the share of the additional dollar of income a person decides to devote to consumption expenditures. The marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the share of the additional dollar a person decides to save. It must always hold true that:\n\\[MPC + MPS = 1\\]\nFor example, if the marginal propensity to consume out of the marginal amount of income earned is 0.9, then the marginal propensity to save is 0.1.\nWith this relationship in mind, consider the relationship among income, consumption, and savings shown in Figure 13.1. (Note that we use “Aggregate Expenditure” on the vertical axis in this and the following figures, because all consumption expenditures are parts of aggregate expenditures.)\nAn assumption commonly made in this model is that even if income were zero, people would have to consume something. In this example, consumption would be $600 even if income were zero. Then, the MPC is 0.8 and the MPS is 0.2. Thus, when income increases by $1,000, consumption rises by $800 and savings rises by $200. At an income of $4,000, total consumption will be the $600 that would be consumed even without any income, plus $4,000 multiplied by the marginal propensity to consume of 0.8, or $ 3,200, for a total of $ 3,800. The total amount of consumption and saving must always add up to the total amount of income. (Exactly how a situation of zero income and negative savings would work in practice is not important, because even low-income societies are not literally at zero income, so the point is hypothetical.) This relationship between income and consumption, illustrated in Figure 13.2 and Table 13.1, is called the consumption function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: The Consumption Function. In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the level of national income? Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value of all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy. At a national income level of zero, $600 is consumed. Then, each time income rises by $1,000, consumption rises by $800, because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows an upward-sloping line representative of the consumption function.\nThe pattern of consumption shown in Table 13.1 is plotted in Figure 13.2. To calculate consumption, multiply the income level by 0.8, for the marginal propensity to consume, and add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. Consumption plus savings must be equal to income.\n\n\n\nTable 13.1: The Consumption Function\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nConsumption\nSavings\n\n\n\n\n$0\n$600\n–$600\n\n\n$1,000\n$1,400\n–$400\n\n\n$2,000\n$2,200\n–$200\n\n\n$3,000\n$3,000\n$0\n\n\n$4,000\n$3,800\n$200\n\n\n$5,000\n$4,600\n$400\n\n\n$6,000\n$5,400\n$600\n\n\n$7,000\n$6,200\n$800\n\n\n$8,000\n$7,000\n$1,000\n\n\n$9,000\n$7,800\n$1,200\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a number of factors other than income can also cause the entire consumption function to shift. These factors were summarized in the earlier discussion of consumption, and listed in Table 13.1. When the consumption function moves, it can shift in two ways: either the entire consumption function can move up or down in a parallel manner, or the slope of the consumption function can shift so that it becomes steeper or flatter.\nFor example, if a tax cut leads consumers to spend more, but does not affect their marginal propensity to consume, it would cause an upward shift to a new consumption function that is parallel to the original one. However, a change in household preferences for saving that reduced the marginal propensity to save would cause the slope of the consumption function to become steeper: that is, if the savings rate is lower, then every increase in income leads to a larger rise in consumption.\n\n\n13.2.2 Investment as a Function of National Income\nInvestment decisions are forward-looking, based on expected rates of return. Precisely because investment decisions depend primarily on perceptions about future economic conditions, they do not depend primarily on the level of GDP in the current year. Thus, on a Keynesian cross diagram, the investment function can be drawn as a horizontal line, at a fixed level of expenditure.\nFigure 13.3 shows an investment function where the level of investment is, for the sake of concreteness, set at the specific level of 500. Just as a consumption function shows the relationship between consumption levels and real GDP (or national income), the investment function shows the relationship between investment levels and real GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: The Investment Function. The investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based on interest rates and expectations about the future, and so it does not change with the level of current national income. In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the investment function to shift up or down.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows a straight, horizontal line at 500 on the y-axis, representative of the investment function.\nThe appearance of the investment function as a horizontal line does not mean that the level of investment never moves. It means only that in the context of this two-dimensional diagram, the level of investment on the vertical aggregate expenditure axis does not vary according to the current level of real GDP on the horizontal axis. However, all the other factors that vary investment—new technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, interest rates, the price of key inputs, and tax incentives for investment—can cause the horizontal investment function to shift up or down.\n\n\n13.2.3 Government Spending and Taxes as a Function of National Income\nIn the Keynesian cross diagram, government spending appears as a horizontal line, as in Figure, where government spending is set at a level of 1,300. As in the case of investment spending, this horizontal line does not mean that government spending is unchanging. It means only that government spending changes when Congress decides on a change in the budget, rather than shifting in a predictable way with the current size of the real GDP shown on the horizontal axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: The Government Spending Function. The level of government spending is determined by political factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this example, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional decisions to increase government spending will cause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows a straight, horizontal line at 1,300, representative of the government spending function.\nThe situation of taxes is different because taxes often rise or fall with the volume of economic activity. For example, income taxes are based on the level of income earned and sales taxes are based on the amount of sales made, and both income and sales tend to be higher when the economy is growing and lower when the economy is in a recession. For the purposes of constructing the basic Keynesian cross diagram, it is helpful to view taxes as a proportionate share of GDP. In the United States, for example, taking federal, state, and local taxes together, government typically collects about 30–35 % of income as taxes.\nTable 13.2 revises the earlier table on the consumption function so that it takes taxes into account. The first column shows national income. The second column calculates taxes, which in this example are set at a rate of 30%, or 0.3. The third column shows after-tax income; that is, total income minus taxes. The fourth column then calculates consumption in the same manner as before: multiply after-tax income by 0.8, representing the marginal propensity to consume, and then add $600, for the amount that would be consumed even if income was zero. When taxes are included, the marginal propensity to consume is reduced by the amount of the tax rate, so each additional dollar of income results in a smaller increase in consumption than before taxes. For this reason, the consumption function, with taxes included, is flatter than the consumption function without taxes, as Figure 13.5 shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes. The upper line repeats the consumption function from Figure. The lower line shows the consumption function if taxes must first be paid on income, and then consumption is based on after-tax income.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows two upward-sloping lines. The steeper of the two lines is the consumption before taxes. The more gradual of the two lines is the consumption after taxes.\n\n\n\nTable 13.2: The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome\nTaxes\nAfter-Tax Income\nConsumption\nSavings\n\n\n\n\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$600\n–$600\n\n\n$1,000\n$300\n$700\n$1,160\n–$460\n\n\n$2,000\n$600\n$1,400\n$1,720\n–$320\n\n\n$3,000\n$900\n$2,100\n$2,280\n–$180\n\n\n$4,000\n$1,200\n$2,800\n$2,840\n–$40\n\n\n$5,000\n$1,500\n$3,500\n$3,400\n$100\n\n\n$6,000\n$1,800\n$4,200\n$3,960\n$240\n\n\n$7,000\n$2,100\n$4,900\n$4,520\n$380\n\n\n$8,000\n$2,400\n$5,600\n$5,080\n$520\n\n\n$9,000\n$2,700\n$6,300\n$5,640\n$660\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.2.4 Exports and Imports as a Function of National Income\nThe export function, which shows how exports change with the level of a country’s own real GDP, is drawn as a horizontal line, as in the example in Figure 13.6 (a) where exports are drawn at a level of $840. Again, as in the case of investment spending and government spending, drawing the export function as horizontal does not imply that exports never change. It just means that they do not change because of what is on the horizontal axis—that is, a country’s own level of domestic production—and instead are shaped by the level of aggregate demand in other countries. More demand for exports from other countries would cause the export function to shift up; less demand for exports from other countries would cause it to shift down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: The Export and Import Functions.Panel (a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line because exports are determined by the buying power of other countries and thus do not change with the size of the domestic economy. In this example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down, depending on buying patterns in other countries. (b) The import function is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported products are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this example, the marginal propensity to import is 0.1, so imports are calculated by multiplying the level of income by –0.1.\n\n\n\nThe graph on the left show exports as a straight, horizontal line at $840. The graph on the right shows imports as a downward-sloping line beginning at $0.\nImports are drawn in the Keynesian cross diagram as a downward-sloping line, with the downward slope determined by the marginal propensity to import (MPI), out of national income.\nIn Figure (b), the marginal propensity to import is 0.1. Thus, if real GDP is $5,000, imports are $500; if national income is $6,000, imports are $600, and so on. The import function is drawn as downward sloping and negative, because it represents a subtraction from the aggregate expenditures in the domestic economy. A change in the marginal propensity to import, perhaps as a result of changes in preferences, would alter the slope of the import function.\n\n\n13.2.5 USING AN ALGEBRAIC APPROACH TO THE EXPENDITURE-OUTPUT MODEL\nIn the expenditure-output or Keynesian cross model, the equilibrium occurs where the aggregate expenditure line (AE line) crosses the 45-degree line. Given algebraic equations for two lines, the point where they cross can be readily calculated. Imagine an economy with the following characteristics.\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nY\n= Real GDP or national income\n\n\nT\n= Taxes = 0.3Y\n\n\nC\n= Consumption = 140 + 0.9(Y – T)\n\n\nI\n= Investment = 400\n\n\nG\n= Government spending = 800\n\n\nX\n= Exports = 600\n\n\nM\n= Imports = 0.15Y\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nStep 1.\n\nDetermine the aggregate expenditure function. In this case, it is:\n\\[AE = C + I + G + X – M\\]\n\\[AE = 140 + 0.9(Y – T) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y\\]\n\nStep 2.\n\nThe equation for the 45-degree line is the set of points where GDP or national income on the horizontal axis is equal to aggregate expenditure on the vertical axis. Thus, the equation for the 45-degree line is: AE = Y.\n\nStep 3.\n\nThe next step is to solve these two equations for Y (or AE, since they will be equal to each other). Substitute Y for AE:\n\\[Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – T) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y\\]\n\nStep 4.\n\nInsert the term \\(0.3 \\times Y\\) for the tax rate T. This produces an equation with only one variable, Y.\n\nStep 5.\n\nWork through the algebra and solve for Y.\n\\[Y = 140 + 0.9 \\times (Y – 0.3 \\times Y) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.15 \\times Y\\]\n\\[Y = 140 + 0.9 \\times Y – 0.27 \\times Y + 1800 – 0.15 \\times Y\\]\n\\[Y = 1940 + 0.48 \\times Y\\]\n\\[Y – 0.48 \\times Y = 1940\\]\n\\[0.52 \\times Y = 1940\\]\n\\[Y = 3730\\]\nThis algebraic framework is flexible and useful in predicting how economic events and policy actions will affect real GDP.\n\nStep 6.\n\nSay, for example, that because of changes in the relative prices of domestic and foreign goods, the marginal propensity to import falls to 0.1. Calculate the equilibrium output when the marginal propensity to import is changed to 0.1.\n\\[Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 400 + 800 + 600 – 0.1Y\\]\n\\[Y = 1940 – 0.53Y\\]\n\\[0.47Y = 1940\\]\n\\[Y = 4127\\]\n\nStep 7.\n\nBecause of a surge of business confidence, investment rises to 500. Calculate the equilibrium output.\n\\[Y = 140 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 500 + 800 + 600 – 0.15Y\\]\n\\[Y = 2040 + 0.48Y\\]\n\\[Y – 0.48Y = 2040\\]\n\\[0.52Y = 2040\\]\n\\[Y = 3923\\]\nFor issues of policy, the key questions would be how to adjust government spending levels or tax rates so that the equilibrium level of output is the full employment level. In this case, let the economic parameters be:\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nY\n= National income\n\n\nT\n= Taxes = 0.3Y\n\n\nC\n= Consumption = 200 + 0.9(Y – T)\n\n\nI\n= Investment = 600\n\n\nG\n= Government spending = 1,000\n\n\nX\n= Exports = 600\n\n\nY\n= Imports = 0.1(Y – T)\n\n\n\n\nStep 8.\n\nCalculate the equilibrium for this economy (remember Y = AE).\n\\[Y = 200 + 0.9(Y – 0.3Y) + 600 + 1000 + 600 – 0.1(Y – 0.3Y)\\]\n\\[Y – 0.63Y + 0.07Y = 2400\\]\n\\[0.44Y = 2400\\]\n\\[Y = 5454\\]\n\nStep 9.\n\nAssume that the full employment level of output is 6,000. What level of government spending would be necessary to reach that level? To answer this question, plug in 6,000 as equal to Y, but leave G as a variable, and solve for G. Thus:\n\\[6000 = 200 + 0.9(6000 – 0.3(6000)) + 600 + G + 600 – 0.1(6000 – 0.3(6000))\\]\n\nStep 10.\n\nSolve this problem arithmetically. The answer is: G = 1,240. In other words, increasing government spending by 240, from its original level of 1,000, to 1,240, would raise output to the full employment level of GDP.\nIndeed, the question of how much to increase government spending so that equilibrium output will rise from 5,454 to 6,000 can be answered without working through the algebra, just by using the multiplier formula. The multiplier equation in this case is:\n\\[\\frac{1}{1 – 0.56} = 2.27\\]\nThus, to raise output by 546 would require an increase in government spending of 546/2.27=240, which is the same as the answer derived from the algebraic calculation.\n\n\n\n\nThis algebraic framework is highly flexible. For example, taxes can be treated as a total set by political considerations (like government spending) and not dependent on national income. Imports might be based on before-tax income, not after-tax income. For certain purposes, it may be helpful to analyze the economy without exports and imports. A more complicated approach could divide up consumption, investment, government, exports and imports into smaller categories, or to build in some variability in the rates of taxes, savings, and imports. A wise economist will shape the model to fit the specific question under investigation.\n\n\n13.2.6 Building the Combined Aggregate Expenditure Function\nAll the components of aggregate demand—consumption, investment, government spending, and the trade balance—are now in place to build the Keynesian cross diagram. Figure 13.7 builds up an aggregate expenditure function, based on the numerical illustrations of C, I, G, X, and M that have been used throughout this text. The first three columns in Table 13.3 are lifted from the earlier Table 13.2 , which showed how to bring taxes into the consumption function. The first column is real GDP or national income, which is what appears on the horizontal axis of the income-expenditure diagram. The second column calculates after-tax income, based on the assumption, in this case, that 30% of real GDP is collected in taxes.\nThe third column is based on an MPC of 0.8, so that as after-tax income rises by $700 from one row to the next, consumption rises by $560 (700 × 0.8) from one row to the next. Investment, government spending, and exports do not change with the level of current national income. In the previous discussion, investment was $500, government spending was $1,300, and exports were $840, for a total of $2,640. This total is shown in the fourth column. Imports are 0.1 of real GDP in this example, and the level of imports is calculated in the fifth column. The final column, aggregate expenditures, sums up C + I + G + X – M. This aggregate expenditure line is illustrated in Figure 13.7.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: A Keynesian Cross Diagram. Each combination of national income and aggregate expenditure (after-tax consumption, government spending, investment, exports, and imports) is graphed. The equilibrium occurs where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line, at a real GDP of $6,000. Potential GDP in this example is $7,000, so the equilibrium is occurring at a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP level.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows a Keynesian cross diagram with each combination of national income and aggregate expenditure.\n\n\n\nTable 13.3: National Income-Aggregate Expenditure Equilibrium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNat.

The point at which the aggregate expenditure function intersects the vertical axis will be determined by the levels of investment, government, and export expenditures—which do not vary with national income. The upward slope of the aggregate expenditure function will be determined by the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, and the marginal propensity to import. A higher marginal propensity to save, a higher tax rate, and a higher marginal propensity to import will all make the slope of the aggregate expenditure function flatter—because out of any extra income, more is going to savings or taxes or imports and less to spending on domestic goods and services.\nThe equilibrium occurs where national income is equal to aggregate expenditure, which is shown on the graph as the point where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line. In this example, the equilibrium occurs at 6,000. This equilibrium can also be read off the table under the figure; it is the level of national income where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe consumption function shows the upward-sloping relationship between national income and consumption.\nThe marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the amount consumed out of an additional dollar of income.\nA higher marginal propensity to consume means a steeper consumption function; a lower marginal propensity to consume means a flatter consumption function.\nThe marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the amount saved out of an additional dollar of income. It is necessarily true that MPC + MPS = 1.\nThe investment function is drawn as a flat line, showing that investment in the current year does not change with regard to the current level of national income. However, the investment function will move up and down based on the expected rate of return in the future.\nGovernment spending is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because its level is determined by political considerations, not by the current level of income in the economy. Taxes in the basic Keynesian cross diagram are taken into account by adjusting the consumption function.\nThe export function is drawn as a horizontal line in the Keynesian cross diagram, because exports do not change as a result of changes in domestic income, but they move as a result of changes in foreign income, as well as changes in exchange rates.\nThe import function is drawn as a downward-sloping line, because imports rise with national income, but imports are a subtraction from aggregate demand. Thus, a higher level of imports means a lower level of expenditure on domestic goods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat determines the slope of a consumption function?\nWhat is the marginal propensity to consume, and how is it related to the marginal propensity to import?\nWhy are the investment function, the government spending function, and the export function all drawn as flat lines?\nWhy does the import function slope down? What is the marginal propensity to import?\nWhat are the components on which the aggregate expenditure function is based?",

    "text": "13.3 Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nEquilibrium\nEquilibrium Cross Model\nKeynesian Cross Model\nRecessionary and Inflationary Gaps\n\n\n\nWith the aggregate expenditure line in place, the next step is to relate it to the two other elements of the Keynesian cross diagram. Thus, the first subsection interprets the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line, while the next subsection relates this point of intersection to the potential GDP line.\n\n13.3.1 Where Equilibrium Occurs\nThe point where the aggregate expenditure line that is constructed from C + I + G + X – M crosses the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium for the economy. It is the only point on the aggregate expenditure line where the total amount being spent on aggregate demand equals the total level of production. In Figure 13.7, this point of equilibrium (E0) happens at 6,000, which can also be read off Table 13.3.\nThe meaning of “equilibrium” remains the same; that is, equilibrium is a point of balance where no incentive exists to shift away from that outcome. To understand why the point of intersection between the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is a macroeconomic equilibrium, consider what would happen if an economy found itself to the right of the equilibrium point E, say point H in Figure 13.8, where output is higher than the equilibrium. At point H, the level of aggregate expenditure is below the 45-degree line, so that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is less than the level of output. As a result, at point H, output is piling up unsold—not a sustainable state of affairs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Diagram. If output was above the equilibrium level, at H, then the real output is greater than the aggregate expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate expenditure would be greater than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that spending exceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be at equilibrium, where output, or national income and aggregate expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points where national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows the only point at which there can be equilibrium in the Keynesian cross diagram.\nConversely, consider the situation where the level of output is at point L—where real output is lower than the equilibrium. In that case, the level of aggregate demand in the economy is above the 45-degree line, indicating that the level of aggregate expenditure in the economy is greater than the level of output. When the level of aggregate demand has emptied the store shelves, it cannot be sustained, either. Firms will respond by increasing their level of production. Thus, the equilibrium must be the point where the amount produced and the amount spent are in balance, at the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFINDING EQUILIBRIUM\nTable 13.4 gives some information on an economy. The Keynesian model assumes that there is some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 – $216 = $20. $20 will be consumed when national income equals zero. Assume that taxes are 0.2 of real GDP. Let the marginal propensity to save of after-tax income be 0.1. The level of investment is $70, the level of government spending is $80, and the level of exports is $50. Imports are 0.2 of after-tax income. Given these values, you need to complete Table and then answer these questions:\n\nWhat is the consumption function?\nWhat is the equilibrium?\nWhy is a national income of $300 not at equilibrium?\nHow do expenditures and output compare at this point?\n\n\n\n\nTable 13.4: National Income-Aggregate Expenditure Equilibrium\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNat.

The marginal propensity to save is given as 0.1. This means that the marginal propensity to consume is 0.9, since MPS + MPC = 1. Therefore, multiply 0.9 by the after-tax income amount using the following as an example:\n\n\n\nItem\nAmount\n\n\n\n\nAfter-tax Income\n$240\n\n\nMPC\n× 0.9\n\n\nConsumption\n$216\n\n\n\n\nStep 4.\n\nConsider why the table shows consumption of $236 in the first row. As mentioned earlier, the Keynesian model assumes that there is some level of consumption even without income. That amount is $236 – $216 = $20.\n\nStep 5.\n\nThere is now enough information to write the consumption function. The consumption function is found by figuring out the level of consumption that will happen when income is zero. Remember that:\n\\[C = \\text{Consumption when national income is zero} + \\text{MPC (after-tax income)}\\]\nLet C represent the consumption function, Y represent national income, and T represent taxes.\n\\[C = $20 + 0.9(Y – T)\n= $20 + 0.9($300 – $60)\n= $236\\]\n\nStep 6.\n\nUse the consumption function to find consumption at each level of national income.\n\nStep 7.\n\nAdd investment (I), government spending (G), and exports (X). Remember that these do not change as national income changes:\n\nStep 8.\n\nFind imports, which are 0.2 of after-tax income at each level of national income. For example:\n\n\n\nItem\nAmount\n\n\n\n\nAfter-tax income\n$240\n\n\nImports of 0.2 or 20% of Y – T\n× 0.2\n\n\nImports\n$48\n\n\n\n\nStep 9.\n\nFind aggregate expenditure by adding C + I + G + X – I for each level of national income.

Equilibrium occurs where AE = Y. Table shows that equilibrium occurs where national income equals aggregate expenditure at $500.\n\nStep 11.\n\nFind equilibrium mathematically, knowing that national income is equal to aggregate expenditure.\n\\[Y = AE\\]\n\\[Y = C + I + G + X – M\\]\n\\[Y = $20 + 0.9(Y – T) + $70 + $80 + $50 – 0.2(Y – T)\\]\n\\[Y = $220 + 0.9(Y – T) – 0.2(Y – T)\\]\nSince T is 0.2 of national income, substitute T with 0.2 Y so that:\n\\[Y = $220 + 0.9(Y – 0.2Y) – 0.2(Y – 0.2Y)\\]\n\\[Y = $220 + 0.9Y – 0.18Y – 0.2Y + 0.04Y\\]\n\\[Y = $220 + 0.56Y\\]\nSolve for Y.\n\\[Y = $220 + 0.56Y\\]\n\\[Y – 0.56Y = $220\\]\n\\[0.44Y = $220\\]\n\\[Y = $500\\]\n\nStep 12.\n\nAnswer this question: Why is a national income of $300 not an equilibrium? At national income of $300, aggregate expenditures are $388.\n\nStep 13.\n\nAnswer this question: How do expenditures and output compare at this point? Aggregate expenditures cannot exceed output (GDP) in the long run, since there would not be enough goods to be bought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.2 Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps\nIn the Keynesian cross diagram, if the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at the level of potential GDP, then the economy is in sound shape. There is no recession, and unemployment is low. But there is no guarantee that the equilibrium will occur at the potential GDP level of output. The equilibrium might be higher or lower.\nFor example, Figure 13.9 (a) illustrates a situation where the aggregate expenditure line intersects the 45-degree line at point E0, which is a real GDP of $6,000, and which is below the potential GDP of $7,000. In this situation, the level of aggregate expenditure is too low for GDP to reach its full employment level, and unemployment will occur. The distance between an output level like E0 that is below potential GDP and the level of potential GDP is called a recessionary gap. Because the equilibrium level of real GDP is so low, firms will not wish to hire the full employment number of workers, and unemployment will be high.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: Addressing Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps. Panel (a) If the equilibrium occurs at an output below potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists. The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule up from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax cuts or government spending increases. Then the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output above potential GDP, then an inflationary gap exists. The policy solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule down from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax increases or spending cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows two images. Image (a) shows policy solutions to address a recessionary gap. Here, the recessionary gap appears to the left of potential GDP. Image (b) shows policy solutions to address an inflationary gap. Here, the inflationary gap appears to the right of potential GDP.\nWhat might cause a recessionary gap? Anything that shifts the aggregate expenditure line down is a potential cause of recession, including a decline in consumption, a rise in savings, a fall in investment, a drop in government spending or a rise in taxes, or a fall in exports or a rise in imports. Moreover, an economy that is at equilibrium with a recessionary gap may just stay there and suffer high unemployment for a long time; remember, the meaning of equilibrium is that there is no particular adjustment of prices or quantities in the economy to chase the recession away.\nThe appropriate response to a recessionary gap is for the government to reduce taxes or increase spending so that the aggregate expenditure function shifts up from AE0 to AE1. When this shift occurs, the new equilibrium E1 now occurs at potential GDP as shown in Figure 13.9 (a).\nConversely, Figure 13.9 (b) shows a situation where the aggregate expenditure schedule (AE0) intersects the 45-degree line above potential GDP. The gap between the level of real GDP at the equilibrium E0 and potential GDP is called an inflationary gap. The inflationary gap also requires a bit of interpreting. After all, a naïve reading of the Keynesian cross diagram might suggest that if the aggregate expenditure function is just pushed up high enough, real GDP can be as large as desired—even doubling or tripling the potential GDP level of the economy. This implication is clearly wrong. An economy faces some supply-side limits on how much it can produce at a given time with its existing quantities of workers, physical and human capital, technology, and market institutions.\nThe inflationary gap should be interpreted, not as a literal prediction of how large real GDP will be, but as a statement of how much extra aggregate expenditure is in the economy beyond what is needed to reach potential GDP. An inflationary gap suggests that because the economy cannot produce enough goods and services to absorb this level of aggregate expenditures, the spending will instead cause an inflationary increase in the price level. In this way, even though changes in the price level do not appear explicitly in the Keynesian cross equation, the notion of inflation is implicit in the concept of the inflationary gap.\nThe appropriate Keynesian response to an inflationary gap is shown in Figure 13.9 (b). The original intersection of aggregate expenditure line AE0 and the 45-degree line occurs at $8,000, which is above the level of potential GDP at $7,000. If AE0 shifts down to AE1, so that the new equilibrium is at E1, then the economy will be at potential GDP without pressures for inflationary price increases. The government can achieve a downward shift in aggregate expenditure by increasing taxes on consumers or firms, or by reducing government expenditures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nIn a Keynesian cross diagram, the equilibrium may be at a level below potential GDP, which is called a recessionary gap, or at a level above potential GDP, which is called an inflationary gap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIs the equilibrium in a Keynesian cross diagram usually expected to be at or near potential GDP?\nWhat is an inflationary gap?

    "text": "13.4 The Multiplier Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nThe Multiplier effect\nCalculating the Multiplier\nCalculating Keynesian Policy Interventions\nMultiplier Tradeoffs\n\n\n\nThe Keynesian policy prescription has one final twist. Assume that for a certain economy, the intersection of the aggregate expenditure function and the 45-degree line is at a GDP of 700, while the level of potential GDP for this economy is $800. By how much does government spending need to be increased so that the economy reaches the full employment GDP? The obvious answer might seem to be $800 – $700 = $100; so raise government spending by $100. But that answer is incorrect. A change of, for example, $100 in government expenditures will have an effect of more than $100 on the equilibrium level of real GDP. The reason is that a change in aggregate expenditures circles through the economy: households buy from firms, firms pay workers and suppliers, workers and suppliers buy goods from other firms, those firms pay their workers and suppliers, and so on. In this way, the original change in aggregate expenditures is actually spent more than once. This is called the multiplier effect: An initial increase in spending, cycles repeatedly through the economy and has a larger impact than the initial dollar amount spent.\n\n13.4.1 How Does the Multiplier Work?\nTo understand how the multiplier effect works, return to the example in which the current equilibrium in the Keynesian cross diagram is a real GDP of $700, or $100 short of the $800 needed to be at full employment, potential GDP. If the government spends $100 to close this gap, someone in the economy receives that spending and can treat it as income. Assume that those who receive this income pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, spend 10% of total income on imports, and then spend the rest on domestically produced goods and services.\n\nVideo - Multiplier\n\n    \n\n\nAs shown in the calculations in Figure 13.10 and Table 13.6, out of the original $100 in government spending, $53 is left to spend on domestically produced goods and services. That $53 which was spent, becomes income to someone, somewhere in the economy. Those who receive that income also pay 30% in taxes, save 10% of after-tax income, and spend 10% of total income on imports, as shown in Figure 13.10, so that an additional $28.09 (that is, 0.53 × $53) is spent in the third round. The people who receive that income then pay taxes, save, and buy imports, and the amount spent in the fourth round is $14.89 (that is, 0.53 × $28.09).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.10: The Multiplier Effect. An original increase of government spending of $100 causes a rise in aggregate expenditure of $100. But that $100 is income to others in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy imports, they spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to others. Thus, the original government spending of $100 is multiplied by these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle gets smaller and smaller. Given the numbers in this example, the original government spending increase of $100 raises aggregate expenditure by $213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 = 2.13.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows the multiplier effect as a rapidly upward-sloping line that levels at $200 and continues as a straight, horizontal line.\n\n\n\nTable 13.6: Calculating the Multiplier Effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRound\nItem\nAmount\n\n\n\n\n1\nOriginal increase in aggregate expenditure from government spending Which is income to people throughout the economy:\n$100\n\n\n\nPay 30% in taxes.\n\n–$30 (net inc.=$70)\n\n\n\nSave 10% of after-tax income.\n\n–$10\n\n\n\nSpend 10% of net income on imports.\n\n–$7\n\n\n2\nSecond-round increase of..\nWhich is $53 of income to people through the economy:\n$70–$7–$10 = $53\n\n\n\nPay 30% in taxes.\n\n–$15.9 (netinc=$37.1)\n\n\n\nSave 10% of after-tax income.\n\n–$5.3\n\n\n\nSpend 10% of income on imports.\n\n–$3.71\n\n\n3\nThird-round increase of…\nWhich is $28.09 of income to people through the economy:\n$37.1–$3.71–$5.3 =$28.09\n\n\n\nPay 30% in taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSave 10% of after-tax income.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpend 10% of income on imports.\n\n\n\n\n4\nFourth-round increase of…\n$19.663 – $1.96633 – $2.809 = $14.89\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus, over the first four rounds of aggregate expenditures, the impact of the original increase in government spending of $100 creates a rise in aggregate expenditures of $100 + $53 + $28.09 + $14.89 = $195.98. Figure 13.10 shows these total aggregate expenditures after these first four rounds, and then the Figure 13.10 shows the total aggregate expenditures after 30 rounds.\nThe additional boost to aggregate expenditures is shrinking in each round of consumption. After about 10 rounds, the additional increments are very small indeed—nearly invisible to the naked eye. After 30 rounds, the additional increments in each round are so small that they have no practical consequence. After 30 rounds, the cumulative value of the initial boost in aggregate expenditure is approximately $213.\nThus, the government spending increase of $100 eventually, after many cycles, produced an increase of $213 in aggregate expenditure and real GDP. In this example, the multiplier is $213/$100 = 2.13.\n\n\n13.4.2 Calculating the Multiplier\nFortunately for everyone who is not carrying around a computer with a spreadsheet program to project the impact of an original increase in expenditures over 20, 50, or 100 rounds of spending, there is a formula for calculating the multiplier.\n\\[\\text{Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 – (MPC * (1 – tax rate) - MPI)}\\]\nor alternatively\n\\[\\text{Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 – MPC * (1 – tax rate) + MPI}\\]\nThe data from Figure 13.10 and Table 13.6 is:\n\n\nMarginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = 30%\nTax rate = 10%\nMarginal Propensity to Import (MPI) = 10%\n\n\nThe MPC is equal to 1 – MPS, or 0.7. Therefore, the spending multiplier is:\n\\[\\text{Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 – (0.7 – (0.10)(0.7) – 0.10)}\\]\n\\[\\text{Spending Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{0.47} = 2.13\\]\nA change in spending of $100 multiplied by the spending multiplier of 2.13 is equal to a change in GDP of $213. Not coincidentally, this result is exactly what was calculated in Figure 13.10 after many rounds of expenditures cycling through the economy.\nThe size of the multiplier is determined by what proportion of the marginal dollar of income goes into taxes, saving, and imports. These three factors are known as “leakages,” because they determine how much demand “leaks out” in each round of the multiplier effect. If the leakages are relatively small, then each successive round of the multiplier effect will have larger amounts of demand, and the multiplier will be high.\nConversely, if the leakages are relatively large, then any initial change in demand will diminish more quickly in the second, third, and later rounds, and the multiplier will be small. Changes in the size of the leakages—a change in the marginal propensity to save, the tax rate, or the marginal propensity to import—will change the size of the multiplier.\n\n\n13.4.3 Calculating Keynesian Policy Interventions\nReturning to the original question: How much should government spending be increased to produce a total increase in real GDP of $100? If the goal is to increase aggregate demand by $100, and the multiplier is 2.13, then the increase in government spending to achieve that goal would be $100/2.13 = $47. Government spending of approximately $47, when combined with a multiplier of 2.13 (which is, remember, based on the specific assumptions about tax, saving, and import rates), produces an overall increase in real GDP of $100, restoring the economy to potential GDP of $800, as Figure 13.11 shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.11: The Multiplier Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model. The power of the multiplier effect is that an increase in expenditure has a larger increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the vertical increase from AE0 to AE1. However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.\n\n\n\nThe graph shows the multiplier effect in the expenditure-output model: an increase in expenditure has a larger increase on the equilibrium output.\nThe multiplier effect is also visible on the Keynesian cross diagram. Figure 13.11 shows the example we have been discussing: a recessionary gap with an equilibrium of $700, potential GDP of $800, the slope of the aggregate expenditure function (AE0) determined by the assumptions that taxes are 30% of income, savings are 0.1 of after-tax income, and imports are 0.1 of before-tax income. At AE1, the aggregate expenditure function is moved up to reach potential GDP.\nNow, compare the vertical shift upward in the aggregate expenditure function, which is $47, with the horizontal shift outward in real GDP, which is $100 (as these numbers were calculated earlier). The rise in real GDP is more than double the rise in the aggregate expenditure function. (Similarly, if you look back at Figure 13.9, you will see that the vertical movements in the aggregate expenditure functions are smaller than the change in equilibrium output that is produced on the horizontal axis. Again, this is the multiplier effect at work.) In this way, the power of the multiplier is apparent in the income–expenditure graph, as well as in the arithmetic calculation.\nThe multiplier does not just affect government spending, but applies to any change in the economy. Say that business confidence declines and investment falls off, or that the economy of a leading trading partner slows down so that export sales decline. These changes will reduce aggregate expenditures, and then will have an even larger effect on real GDP because of the multiplier effect. Read the following Clear It Up feature to learn how the multiplier effect can be applied to analyze the economic impact of professional sports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW CAN THE MULTIPLIER BE USED TO ANALYZE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF PROFESSIONAL SPORTS?\nAttracting professional sports teams and building sports stadiums to create jobs and stimulate business growth is an economic development strategy adopted by many communities throughout the United States. In his recent article, “Public Financing of Private Sports Stadiums,” James Joyner of Outside the Beltway looked at public financing for NFL teams. Joyner’s findings confirm the earlier work of John Siegfried of Vanderbilt University and Andrew Zimbalist of Smith College.\nSiegfried and Zimbalist used the multiplier to analyze this issue. They considered the amount of taxes paid and dollars spent locally to see if there was a positive multiplier effect. Since most professional athletes and owners of sports teams are rich enough to owe a lot of taxes, let’s say that 40% of any marginal income they earn is paid in taxes. Because athletes are often high earners with short careers, let’s assume that they save one-third of their after-tax income.\nHowever, many professional athletes do not live year-round in the city in which they play, so let’s say that one-half of the money that they do spend is spent outside the local area. One can think of spending outside a local economy, in this example, as the equivalent of imported goods for the national economy.\nNow, consider the impact of money spent at local entertainment venues other than professional sports. While the owners of these other businesses may be comfortably middle-income, few of them are in the economic stratosphere of professional athletes. Because their incomes are lower, so are their taxes; say that they pay only 35% of their marginal income in taxes. They do not have the same ability, or need, to save as much as professional athletes, so let’s assume their MPC is just 0.8. Finally, because more of them live locally, they will spend a higher proportion of their income on local goods—say, 65%.\nIf these general assumptions hold true, then money spent on professional sports will have less local economic impact than money spent on other forms of entertainment. For professional athletes, out of a dollar earned, 40 cents goes to taxes, leaving 60 cents. Of that 60 cents, one-third is saved, leaving 40 cents, and half is spent outside the area, leaving 20 cents. Only 20 cents of each dollar is cycled into the local economy in the first round. For locally-owned entertainment, out of a dollar earned, 35 cents goes to taxes, leaving 65 cents. Of the rest, 20% is saved, leaving 52 cents, and of that amount, 65% is spent in the local area, so that 33.8 cents of each dollar of income is recycled into the local economy.\nSiegfried and Zimbalist make the plausible argument that, within their household budgets, people have a fixed amount to spend on entertainment. If this assumption holds true, then money spent attending professional sports events is money that was not spent on other entertainment options in a given metropolitan area. Since the multiplier is lower for professional sports than for other local entertainment options, the arrival of professional sports to a city would reallocate entertainment spending in a way that causes the local economy to shrink, rather than to grow. Thus, their findings seem to confirm what Joyner reports and what newspapers across the country are reporting. A quick Internet search for “economic impact of sports” will yield numerous reports questioning this economic development strategy.\n\n\n\n\n13.4.4 Multiplier Tradeoffs: Stability versus the Power of Macroeconomic Policy\nIs an economy healthier with a high multiplier or a low one? With a high multiplier, any change in aggregate demand will tend to be substantially magnified, and so the economy will be more unstable. With a low multiplier, by contrast, changes in aggregate demand will not be multiplied much, so the economy will tend to be more stable.\nHowever, with a low multiplier, government policy changes in taxes or spending will tend to have less impact on the equilibrium level of real output. With a higher multiplier, government policies to raise or reduce aggregate expenditures will have a larger effect. Thus, a low multiplier means a more stable economy, but also weaker government macroeconomic policy, while a high multiplier means a more volatile economy, but also an economy in which government macroeconomic policy is more powerful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe multiplier effect describes how an initial change in aggregate demand generated several times as much as cumulative GDP. The size of the spending multiplier is determined by three leakages: spending on savings, taxes, and imports. The formula for the multiplier is:\n\n\\[\\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 – (MPC × (1 – tax rate) - MPI)}\\]\n\nor also\n\n\\[\\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 – MPC × (1 – tax rate) + MPI}\\]\n\nIn the lecture notes we denote the MPC as \\(b\\) and the MPI as \\(m\\). There are also no taxes in the lecture notes example so that the multiplier there is written as:\n\n\\[\\text{Multiplier} = \\frac{1}{1 – (b - m)}\\]\n\nAn economy with a lower multiplier is more stable—it is less affected either by economic events or by government policy than an economy with a higher multiplier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the multiplier effect?\nWhy are savings, taxes, and imports referred to as “leakages” in calculating the multiplier effect?\nWill an economy with a high multiplier be more stable or less stable than an economy with a low multiplier in response to changes in the economy or in government policy?\nHow do economists use the multiplier?\nWhich model, the AD/AS or the AE model better explains the relationship between rising price levels and GDP? Why?\nWhat are some reasons that the economy might be in a recession, and what is the appropriate government action to alleviate the recession?\nWhat should the government do to relieve inflationary pressures if the aggregate expenditure is greater than potential GDP?\nTwo countries are in a recession. Country A has an MPC of 0.8 and Country B has an MPC of 0.6. In which country will government spending have the greatest impact?\nCompare two policies: a tax cut on income or an increase in government spending on roads and bridges. What are both the short-term and long-term impacts of such policies on the economy?\nWhat role does government play in stabilizing the economy and what are the tradeoffs that must be considered?\nIf there is a recessionary gap of $100 billion, should the government increase spending by $100 billion to close the gap? Why? Why not?\nWhat other changes in the economy can be evaluated by using the multiplier?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: The Expenditure-Output Diagram. The aggregate expenditure-output model shows aggregate expenditures on the vertical axis and real GDP on the horizontal axis. A vertical line shows potential GDP where full employment occurs. The 45-degree line shows all points where aggregate expenditures and output are equal. The aggregate expenditure schedule shows how total spending or aggregate expenditure increases as output or real GDP rises. The intersection of the aggregate expenditure schedule and the 45-degree line will be the equilibrium. Equilibrium occurs at E0, where aggregate expenditure AE0 is equal to the output level Y0.\nFigure 13.2: The Consumption Function. In the expenditure-output model, how does consumption increase with the level of national income? Output on the horizontal axis is conceptually the same as national income, since the value of all final output that is produced and sold must be income to someone, somewhere in the economy. At a national income level of zero, $600 is consumed. Then, each time income rises by $1,000, consumption rises by $800, because in this example, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8.\nFigure 13.3: The Investment Function. The investment function is drawn as a flat line because investment is based on interest rates and expectations about the future, and so it does not change with the level of current national income. In this example, investment expenditures are at a level of 500. However, changes in factors like technological opportunities, expectations about near-term economic growth, and interest rates would all cause the investment function to shift up or down.\nFigure 13.4: The Government Spending Function. The level of government spending is determined by political factors, not by the level of real GDP in a given year. Thus, government spending is drawn as a horizontal line. In this example, government spending is at a level of 1,300. Congressional decisions to increase government spending will cause this horizontal line to shift up, while decisions to reduce spending would cause it to shift down.\nFigure 13.5: The Consumption Function Before and After Taxes. The upper line repeats the consumption function from Figure. The lower line shows the consumption function if taxes must first be paid on income, and then consumption is based on after-tax income.\nFigure 13.6: The Export and Import Functions.Panel (a) The export function is drawn as a horizontal line because exports are determined by the buying power of other countries and thus do not change with the size of the domestic economy. In this example, exports are set at 840. However, exports can shift up or down, depending on buying patterns in other countries. (b) The import function is drawn in negative territory because expenditures on imported products are a subtraction from expenditures in the domestic economy. In this example, the marginal propensity to import is 0.1, so imports are calculated by multiplying the level of income by –0.1.\nFigure 13.7: A Keynesian Cross Diagram. Each combination of national income and aggregate expenditure (after-tax consumption, government spending, investment, exports, and imports) is graphed. The equilibrium occurs where aggregate expenditure is equal to national income; this occurs where the aggregate expenditure schedule crosses the 45-degree line, at a real GDP of $6,000. Potential GDP in this example is $7,000, so the equilibrium is occurring at a level of output or real GDP below the potential GDP level.\nFigure 13.8: Equilibrium in the Keynesian Cross Diagram. If output was above the equilibrium level, at H, then the real output is greater than the aggregate expenditure in the economy. This pattern cannot hold, because it would mean that goods are produced but piling up unsold. If output was below the equilibrium level at L, then aggregate expenditure would be greater than output. This pattern cannot hold either, because it would mean that spending exceeds the number of goods being produced. Only point E can be at equilibrium, where output, or national income and aggregate expenditure, are equal. The equilibrium (E) must lie on the 45-degree line, which is the set of points where national income and aggregate expenditure are equal.\nFigure 13.9: Addressing Recessionary and Inflationary Gaps. Panel (a) If the equilibrium occurs at an output below potential GDP, then a recessionary gap exists. The policy solution to a recessionary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule up from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax cuts or government spending increases. Then the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP. (b) If the equilibrium occurs at an output above potential GDP, then an inflationary gap exists. The policy solution to an inflationary gap is to shift the aggregate expenditure schedule down from AE0 to AE1, using policies like tax increases or spending cuts. Then, the new equilibrium E1 occurs at potential GDP.\nFigure 13.10: The Multiplier Effect. An original increase of government spending of $100 causes a rise in aggregate expenditure of $100. But that $100 is income to others in the economy, and after they save, pay taxes, and buy imports, they spend $53 of that $100 in a second round. In turn, that $53 is income to others. Thus, the original government spending of $100 is multiplied by these cycles of spending, but the impact of each successive cycle gets smaller and smaller. Given the numbers in this example, the original government spending increase of $100 raises aggregate expenditure by $213; therefore, the multiplier in this example is $213/$100 = 2.13.\nFigure 13.11: The Multiplier Effect in an Expenditure-Output Model. The power of the multiplier effect is that an increase in expenditure has a larger increase on the equilibrium output. The increase in expenditure is the vertical increase from AE0 to AE1. However, the increase in equilibrium output, shown on the horizontal axis, is clearly larger.",

So if investors feel good about the future state of the economy, they are more likely to invest their funds into projects that start paying off in the future (when the economy is supposedly doing well).\nInvestment spending is therefore highly pro-cyclical and more volatile than GDP.\n\n\nInvestment: A Plunge into the Unknown\n\n\nThe accelerator theory emphasizes the role of expected growth in real GDP on investment spending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample\n\nWhen real GDP growth is expected to be high, firms anticipate that their investments in plant and equipment will be profitable.\nTherefore they increase their total investment spending.\nThis becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as high investments today, will lead to a build up of projects, more hiring so that the economy grows.\n\n\n\nIn his multiplier-accelerator theory, Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson explained\n\n– how a downturn in real GDP leads to a\n– sharp fall in investment, which further\n– reduces GDP through the multiplier for investment spending.\n\nIn this case the story works in the other direction. An expected future downturn of the economy, leads to investors decreasing their investments, since they expect that the payoffs will be small as the economic environment deteriorates. This also becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. If investors think that the future will be bad, then their current actions (i.e., decreases in investments) will contribute to the expected downturn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.1: Investment as percent of GDP\n\n\n\nSwings in investment have occurred over short periods of time. During recessions (noted by the shaded areas), investment spending fell sharply.\nDuring booms, investment spending rose sharply. This means that investment spending is highly pro-cyclical. In other words, private investment is positively correlated with GDP.\n\n\n14.1.2 Evaluating the Future\nA dollar paid today is not the same as a dollar paid next year. Think about the following thought experiment. In a year from now you will need $100 dollars to make a specific purchase. Your rich uncle will give you the money but offers you two options: A) Receive $100 today, or B) Receive $100 a year from now.\nWhich option is better? Keep in mind, you do not need the money right now.\nThe answer is that before you compare the two options you first need to translate the dollar values in a common unit. A dollar today is not the same thing as a dollar next year. Why is that?\nLet's demonstrate this and assume that currently the market interest that a bank offers for deposits is 4%. If you go with option A above and receive the $100 dollars today, then you could put those $100 into your bank account where it will earn 4%. So in a year from now you will have $104 dollars. Had you gone with option B above, you would only have $100 a year from now. So, option A is clearly worth more. In tomorrows dollars, option A is worth $104 compared to option B which is only worth $100 dollars in 'tomorrows dollars'. We have thus translated option A into the same unit as option B and we can now compare its value.\nSimilarly you could have expressed both options, A and B, in 'today's dollars'. Option A is worth $100 in todays dollars whereas option B is only worth \\(\\$100/(1+0.04) = \\$96.15\\). Why is that. Well, if your uncle gives you $96.15 dollars today, then you can put that amount into the bank where it will grow to $96.15 (1+0.04) = \\(100\\) dollars next year (i.e., tomorrow)\n\nIf we express dollar values in today's dollars, we refer to the values as the present value.\nThe process of translating future dollar payments into their present value is called discounting.\n\nWhen we divided the $100 payment a year from in option B above with one plus the market interest rate, we discounted the future value back into today's value.\nA different way of thinking about this is as follows. The present value of a payment to be received in the future is the maximum amount a person is willing to pay today to get that payment later.\nAs the interest rate increases, the opportunity cost of your funds also increases, so the present value of a given payment in the future falls. This means that you need less money today to get to your future “money goal”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPresent Value and Interest Rates\nPresent value definition:\n\\[PV=\\frac{K}{\\left(1+i\\right)^{t}}\\]\n\nK= amount of money you would get at some point in the future\nt=amount of time, or years, in the future you’re going to get the money\ni=interest rate you are going to earn\n\n\n\nThe present value of a given payment in the future decreases as the interest rate increases. When interest rates fall, the present value of a given payment in the future increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample 1\nFuture payment one year from now:\n\\[K=\\$400, t=1, i=3\\%\\]\nPresent value definition:\n\\[PV=\\frac{400}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)^{1}}=388.35\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample 2\nFuture payment two years from now:\n\\[K=\\$400,  t=2, i=3\\% \\text{ for both years}\\]\nPresent value definition:\n\\[PV=\\frac{400}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)^{2}}=377.04\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample 3\nTwo future payments: $400 one year from now and $450 two years from now\n\\[t=2, i=3\\% \\text{ for both years }\\]\nPresent value definition:\n\\[PV=\\frac{400}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)}+\\frac{450}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)^{2}}=812.52\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample 4\nFuture payment two years from now:\n\\[K=\\$400, t=2, i_{1}=3\\% \\text{ in year one and } i_{2}=5\\% \\text{ in year\ntwo}\\]\nPresent value definition:\n\\[PV=\\frac{400}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)\\times\\left(1+0.05\\right)}=369.86\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample 5\n\nTwo future payments: $400 one year from now and $450 two years from now\n\\(i_{1}=3\\%\\) in year one and \\(i_{2}=5\\%\\) in year two\n\nPresent value definition:\n\\[PV=\\frac{400}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)}+\\frac{450}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)\\times\\left(1+0.05\\right)}=804.44\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample 6\n\nInvestment project with initial setup cost of: $600\nTwo future payments: $400 one year from now and $450 two years from now\n\\(i_{1}=3\\%\\) in year one and \\(i_{2}=5\\%\\) in year two\n\nPresent value definition:\n\\[NPV=-600+\\overset{PV}{\\overbrace{\\frac{400}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)}+\\frac{450}{\\left(1+0.03\\right)\\times\\left(1+0.05\\right)}}}=204.44\\]\nThis is often referred to as the net-present value (NPV)\nInvestment rule: if \\(NPV &gt; 0 \\rightarrow\\) make investment!\n\n\n\n\n14.1.3 Real and Nominal Interest Rates\nCalculating the true cost of borrowing or lending involves the reality principle:\n\nReal-Nominal PRINCIPLE\nWhat matters to people is the real value of money or income—its purchasing power—not the “face” value of money or income\n\nWhen there is inflation, economists make a distinction between the interest rate quoted in the market, i.e., the nominal interest rate, and the real interest rate which measures what an investor/household actually earns after inflation has been taken into account.\n\n\nReal rate = Nominal rate – Inflation rate\n\n\nNominal and Real Interest Rates\nA bond is a promise or IOU to pay money in the future in exchange for money now\nMoney is paid back including an interest payment\n\n\nReal interest rate: r\nNominal interest rate: i\nInflation rate:\\(\\pi\\), so that\n\n\n\\[r=i-\\pi\\]\n\n\n14.1.4 Expected Inflation\nWhen individuals borrow or lend, they do not know what the rate of inflation, \\(\\pi\\) will be.

A bond is a piece of paper issues by a government (government or treasury bond), a firm (corporate bond) or a private person (I.O.U debt contract) that states the amount owed at a certain time in the future.\n\n\nCorporate bonds are considered more risky than federal government bonds, so they have to pay a higher interest rate in order to compensate investors for the additional risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.2: Returns on bonds over time\n\n\n\n\nThe value of corporate bonds, depends on the well being of the corporation that issues the debt contract. If a firm goes out of business, its debt contracts might not be served, so that investors in bonds of this company will then lose all or parts of their money.\nThe value of a government bond depends on the underlying value of the entire economy that the government represents. It is less likely that an entire country declares bankruptcy. So overall, corporate bonds, or debt contracts, are therefore more risky.\nLong term investments are more risky than short term investments, so they pay a higher interest rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nNominal interest rate\nReal interest rate\nBonds and rates of return\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean when we say investment is pro-cyclical?\nWhy is the distinction between nominal and real interest rates important?",

    "text": "14.2 Investment Spending and Interest Rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nInvestments and interest rates\nInvestment theories\n\n\n\nInterest rate provides a measure of opportunity cost for investments. If you do not invest your money into a private investment project, you can always put it into the bank where it earns the market interest rate. So the opportunity cost of investing in the private sector is the forgone interest rate.\n\n14.2.1 Investment Spending and Interest Rates\nNow that we understand the concept of present value and interest rates, we can use these tools to understand investment decisions. Consider a project we have to pay for today in order to benefit in the future. Only if the investment projects promises to pay a higher rent than the prevailing market interest rate, would it be profitable to invest.\n\nInvestment Rule:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nInvestment Rule Invest in a project if the cost you incur today is less than or equal to the present value of the future payments from the project.\n\n\nHere is a brief example. You have the opportunity to invest in a number of different investment projects. Their initial cost and their payoff at the end of the year is depicted in the following table.\n\nReturn on Investment\n\n\nProject\nCost\nReturn\n\n\n\n\nA\n$100\n$101\n\n\nB\n$100\n$103\n\n\nC\n$100\n$105\n\n\nD\n$100\n$107\n\n\nE\n$100\n$109\n\n\n\nLet us assume that the current market interest rate is 2% per year. If that is the case then only investment A is unprofitable. All other projects earn a return higher than the market interest rate, that is return greater than the opportunity cost of the funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.3: Investment and the Price of Investment\n\n\n\nAs you can see from Figure 14.3, as the market interest rate rises, there will be fewer profitable investments. Hence, the total level of investment will decline as real interest increases\nIn practice, firms need to take into account other factors besides interest rates in making their investment decisions. In the neoclassical theory of investment, pioneered by Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, taxes along with real interest rates play a key role in determining investment spending. Jorgenson used his theory to analyze how investors respond to a variety of tax incentives, including investment tax credits.\nShould we use a real or nominal interest rate to determine whether to invest? The answer is that it doesn’t really matter, as long as we are consistent. If the future benefits of the project are not adjusted for inflation, then we should use the nominal interest rate because it takes into account overall inflation. That is, inflation is built into the nominal rate, so to speak. But if we first express the future benefits of the investment in current dollars—that is, if we reduce their nominal value by the amount that prices in the economy are expected to increase—then we should use the real rate of interest in our calculations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nI recommend you stick with real interest rates and discounted future cash flows as a rule.\n\n\nKeep this distinction between real and nominal interest rates in mind. If nominal interest rates are 10 percent but inflation is 9 percent, the real rate of interest is only 1 percent. A firm makes its investment decisions by comparing its expected real net return from investment projects to the real rate of interest. Just because nominal interest rates are high does not mean the real interest rate is also high. During the 1970s, homeowners in California understood this. They purchased homes in record numbers, even though it meant borrowing money at interest rates exceeding 10 percent. Buyers were willing to borrow at such high rates because housing prices in California had been rising by more than 10 percent annually, and they believed the trend would continue. They realized, for example, that if housing prices rose by 12 percent per year, they were essentially earning a 2 percent annual return because their mortgage loans were just 10 percent. (They would earn the returns only when they sold their homes.) That would make the real interest rate of the money borrowed -2 percent. This caused a housing boom in California that lasted until housing prices stopped rising at such high rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHigh Interest Rates and High Investment?\nIt is possible to observe high interest rates and high investment levels at the same time. How is this possible? Didn't we just describe an inverse or negative relationship between the market interest rate and the level of investment?\nIf the nominal interest is high and the inflation rate is high as well, then the real interest might actually be low. If real interest is low, then investment is high. It is the real interest rate that ultimately determines the level of investment. If it is low, then the investment level is high.\n\n\n\n\n14.2.2 Investment Theories\nSo far we have talked about the role of interest rates in determining investment levels in the economy.\n\nNeoclassical theory of investment\nThe neoclassial theory of investment states that real interest and taxes are the major factors determining investment (Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University)\n\nIn addition, economists have long noticed a correlation between the stock market and investment spending. All other things being equal, when the level of the stock market is high, investment spending also tends to be high. It makes sense that the two are related. Consider a firm’s options when it wants to finance a new project. The firm really has three choices:\n\n\nFirst, it can rely on its retained earnings—the earnings the firm hasn’t paid out in dividends to its owners.\nSecond, it can borrow funds from a bank or sell corporate bonds to the public.\nThird, it can issue and sell new shares, or stock.\n\n\nWhen a firm’s stock price is high, it can issue shares at a premium and use the proceeds from their sale to finance new investments. The higher the share price, the fewer shares the firm needs to sell to raise capital. This means, essentially, that the cost of the project the firm wants to undertake falls as the company’s stock price climbs. In other words, high stock prices lead to high investment. This is known as the Q-theory of investment, and it was originally developed by the late Nobel Laureate James Tobin of Yale University. In the boom of the late 1990s when the level of the stock market was high along with share prices, many firms financed large investments by selling their shares.\nDuring roughly this same time period, the stock market and investment spending appeared to be even more tightly linked than in the past. Figure 12.4 plots the Standard and Poor’s index of stock prices on the same graph as the share of investment spending as a component of GDP from 1990 to 2013. Looking at a historical example, both the stock market and investment spending rose sharply from 1997, peaking in mid-2000.\nThey then both fell sharply—the stock market plunged, investment spending fell, and the economy entered a recession. This is a typical pattern as you can see in Figure 14.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14.4: Investment share in GDP and stock prices\n\n\n\nThe reason the two were so tightly linked in 1997–2000 was that investors were overly optimistic about the future. They believed that, driven by new technology, the newfound economic prosperity would last forever (or at least certainly longer than it did). With optimistic expectations about the future, stock prices should have been high because stock prices are based on the present value of the dividends people expect firms to pay in the future:\nStock prices are based on the present value of the dividends people expect firms to pay in the future. The price of a stock is the present value of future discounted dividend payments:\n\\[p_{stock}=\\frac{d_{1}}{\\left(1+i\\right)^{1}}+\\frac{d_{2}}{\\left(1+i\\right)^{2}}+\\frac{d_{3}}{\\left(1+i\\right)^{3}}+...\\]\nBecause investors’ expectations about future dividends were high, stock prices were high. Firms, like individual investors, rushed to make massive, long-term investments, particularly in the fiber-optics and telecommunications industries. Some observers questioned whether the expectations were rational. Still, there were enough optimistic investors to sufficiently drive up prices. In many cases, stock prices for companies that had never turned a profit nonetheless soared to astronomical heights.\nUnfortunately, both investors and firms may have been subject to what former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan famously dubbed “irrational exuberance”— something similar to Keynes’s “animal spirits.” Although the economy had performed very well in the late 1990s, it could not grow at those rates forever. Many investors and firms believed it could, though. When they began to realize it couldn’t, the stock market plunged and investment plans were curtailed. What linked the stock market and investment in both their rise and their fall were first optimistic and then pessimistic expectations about the economy. Rather than causing the rise and fall of investment spending, the stock market mirrored expectations about the economy held by firms and individual investors.\nThe Q-theory of investment, developed by Nobel laureate James Tobin of Yale University, links investment spending to stock prices. It states that investment spending increases when stock prices are high. Then, the firm uses its proceeds from the sale of stocks to undertake new investment.\n\nQ-Theory of investment\n\nThe Q-Theory of investment states that stock market prices are one of the major factors in determining the level of investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThere is an inverse relationship between real interest rates and the level of private investment as the interest rate is the opportunity cost of investment.\nThe neoclassial theory of investment states that real interest and taxes are the major factors determining investment (Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University)\nThe Q-Theory of investment states that stock market prices are one of the major factors in determining the level of investment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the central bank raises the interest rate, what happens to private investment?",

    "text": "14.3 Financial Intermediaries\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Intermediaries\n\n\n\nHouseholds save and invest their funds for different reasons than firms. A typical couple might be saving money for their retirement or for their children’s education, and they generally won’t like the idea of their savings being subject to risk. They do, however, want their savings to be readily accessible and convertible to money—what economists call liquid—in case they have a financial emergency. Funds deposited in a bank account, for example, provide a source of liquidity for households because they can be withdrawn at any time.\nUnlike households, firms and business managers are typically risk-takers. They are gambling that their vision of the future will come true and make them vast profits. These investors need funds they can tie up for long periods of time. For example, an entrepreneur who wants to build a skyscraper or casino may need financing for several years before beginning construction and for years afterward until the business begins to produce profits.\nSuppose individual entrepreneurs had to obtain funds directly from individual savers. First, they would have to negotiate with thousands of people to obtain sufficient funds. This would take a lot of time and be costly. Second, the savers would face extraordinarily high risks if they loaned all their money to a single entrepreneur who had a risky project to undertake. Not only would all their funds be tied up in a single project, it would not be easy to monitor the investor’s decisions. How could they be certain the entrepreneur wouldn't run off with their money? Additionally, their investments would not be liquid. To compensate these savers for the risk they would be taking and the lack of liquidity they would face, entrepreneurs would have to pay them extremely high interest rates, but higher interest rates would make it harder, perhaps impossible, for the entrepreneur to make a profit. No prospect of profits would mean no one would invest in the project in the first place. In other words, society would not be able to turn its savings into profitable investment projects. Figure 12.5 depicts this dilemma. How can the problem be solved?\nThe answer is through financial intermediaries. Financial intermediaries include banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, brokerage firms, companies that run mutual funds, and other types of financial institutions. These institutions accept funds from savers and make loans to businesses and individuals. For example, a local bank accepts deposits from savers and uses the funds to make loans to local businesses. Savings and loan institutions will accept deposits in savings accounts and use these funds to make loans, often for housing. Insurance companies accept premium payments from individuals in exchange for the protection provided by the insurance payments. Then insurance companies lend the premiums received to earn returns from investments so they can pay off the insurance claims of individuals. Figure 12.6 shows how financial intermediaries create a valuable link between savers and investors. Pooling the funds of savers to make loans to individual borrowers reduces the costs of negotiation. Financial institutions also have more expertise to evaluate and monitor investments than most individual investors.\nTo some degree, these financial intermediaries also provide liquidity. In normal circumstances, not all households withdraw their money at the same time, so financial intermediaries can lend out most of the money and still have enough on hand to meet withdrawals by depositors.\nBut how do financial intermediaries reduce risk? They do this by diversifying investors’ assets—by not putting “all the eggs in one basket,” so to speak. Intermediaries invest (that is, make loans) in a large number of projects whose returns, although uncertain, are independent of one another. By independent, we mean the return from one investment is unrelated to the return on another investment. Consider a bank investing in a large number of projects that all together produce an average return of 8 percent annually. Each project alone is risky and could pay a return either higher or lower than 8 percent. However, as long as the returns on all these projects are independent of one another, those with higher returns will likely offset those with lower returns. By investing in a large number of projects, the bank increases the odds that as a group the projects will earn 8 percent.\nOther financial intermediaries reduce risks in related ways. A fire insurance company accepts premiums from many individuals in communities throughout the country and uses the funds to make investments. Because not all houses will burn down in the same year, the insurance company knows it will have a stable source of funds for its investments. Insurance diversification works well only when companies insure events that are independent of one another, however. Some situations are not independent and therefore can’t easily be insured by the same company. For example, an insurance company would be unwise to provide earthquake insurance for just the Los Angeles area. If an earthquake did occur, the firm would be faced with making payments to many clients who suffered loss without anyone else’s payments to offset them. In somewhat the same way, even bank loans are not fully independent. During a recession, many more firms will experience financial difficulties and have trouble meeting their loan obligations to their banks.\nIn recent years, we have seen an innovation in financial intermediation. In the past, if a savings and loan company made a loan to a home purchaser, it would hold onto the loan until it was paid off. That meant the savings and loan could make new loans or mortgages only if it was able to attract new deposits to provide the funds. Two large government-sponsored financial intermediaries, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, changed the way mortgage markets operated. They purchased mortgages from savings and loans and banks throughout the country, packaged them, and sold them to investors in the financial market. This enabled savings and loans to offer additional mortgages with the funds they received from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and it allowed investors to own a part of a diversified collection of mortgages from around the country. The private sector quickly adopted these practices as well.\nThe practice of purchasing loans, repackaging them, and selling them to the financial markets is known as securitization. Although it started with home mortgages, securitization now applies to other types of financial obligations, such as credit card and consumer debt. Financial intermediaries will often borrow money from financial markets to purchase loans in order to repackage and sell them. Using borrowed funds to purchase assets is known as leverage. Increases in leverage increase the risk that financial intermediaries undertake because they are obligated to pay off the funds they have borrowed, regardless of the actual performance of the assets they have purchased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome Terms\n\nSecuritization\n\nThe practice of purchasing loans, re-packaging them, and selling them to the financial markets\n\nLeverage\n\nUsing borrowed funds to purchase assets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nWithout intermediaries entrepreneurs would have to borrow directly from households. HH are risk averse and want ready access to their funds. HH would ask very high interest rates to compensate them for the risk. At very high interest rates, only very few investment projects could be realized. Economic growth would be very slow.\nFinancial intermediaries (i.e., Banks and financial institutions) pool assets and lend at a larger scale. This reduces the cost of borrowing and lending and makes investing at a higher level possible.\nIn addition, financial intermediaries:\n-   Monitor investments\n-   Reduce risks via diversification\n-   Provide liquidity\nFinancial intermediaries help bring savers and investors together. By using their expertise and the powers of diversification, financial intermediaries reduce risk to savers and allow investors to obtain funds on better terms.\nWhy Financial Intermediaries Emerge\n\n\nBy pooling the funds of savers and making loans to individual businesses, financial intermediaries reduce the costs of negotiation.\nFinancial intermediaries also acquire expertise in both evaluating and monitoring investments.\nSome financial intermediaries also provide the liquidity that households demand. In the absence of financial intermediaries households would have to lend directly to investors. In this way a household would have her savings tied up in an investment project. What if the investment project only pays of in say 5 years, but the household requires the funds earlier due to an emergency? The household would not be able to access the funds. When a household lends through an intermediary, the intermediary always provides the necessary liquidity. So if the households needs her savings back, then she will be able to withdraw her savings while investment projects are still being undertaking and financed with savings from other households. The financial intermediary pools the savings of many households and is therefore able to not only provide liquidity but also lower risk as the bank invests in many different investment projects and not just in one.\n\n\nFinancial intermediaries are:\n-   Banks,\n-   Insurance companies,\n-   Mutual funds etc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the role of financial intermediaries.",

    "text": "14.4 Financial Innovation and Risk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nFinancial Innovation and Risk\n\n\n\nDuring the housing boom, many homeowners borrowed money to purchase their property but then saw the value of their homes fall sharply. In 2012 approximately 12 million U.S. homeowners owed more on their home mortgages than their home was actually worth, this is commonly known as being “underwater”.\nReducing Debt Owed on Home Mortgages -----------------------------------\nMany in Congress have advocated for reduction on the amount of money they actually owe—or principal reduction. This idea, however, has proven to be extremely controversial for several reasons:\n\nFirst, the holders of the mortgage may not want to reduce the principal because they believe they will be eventually repaid\nSecond, what about those underwater homeowners who are meeting their mortgage payments? Would they stop making payments in order to obtain some principal relief?\nRather than actual principal reduction, some lenders have allowed borrowers to postpone payments or make other arrangements\n\n\n14.4.1 When Financial Intermediaries Malfunction\nFinancial intermediation can sometimes go wrong. When it does, the economy suffers. Important examples of the failure of financial intermediation include commercial bank failures during the Great Depression, the U.S. savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, a similar crisis in Japan in the 1990s, and the U.S. housing credit and securitization crisis of 2007 and 2008.\nIn the early days of the Great Depression, many banks in the United States, particularly in rural areas, provided farmers and local businesses with loans that turned out to be unprofitable. This worried depositors, and rumors circulated that banks would fail. Depositors panicked, and many tried to withdraw their money simultaneously in what is called a bank run. During the Great Depression, bank runs occurred throughout the world. In 1931, a panic broke out after the collapse of Creditanstalt, Austria’s largest bank. Banking panics occurred throughout other countries in Europe, including Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland.\nFew banks, profitable or unprofitable, can survive a run because not all deposits are kept on hand. The result of the bank runs was that thousands of healthy U.S. banks shut down, leaving large parts of the United States without a banking system. Many farms and businesses could no longer find a source of loans, and the severity of the Great Depression worsened. Studies have shown that the countries with the most severe banking panics were hardest hit by the Depression.\nTo prevent banking panics from happening again, in 1933 the U.S. government began providing deposit insurance on money placed in banks and savings and loans. Today deposit insurance guarantees the government will reimburse depositors for amounts up to $250,000 in each account at each bank should their banks fail. Because everyone knows their deposits are secure, bank runs no longer regularly occur. Today, most countries have some form of deposit insurance intended to prevent panics. Ironically, deposit insurance indirectly led to the U.S. savings and loan crisis, which occurred during the 1980s. In the early 1970s, savings and loan institutions (S&Ls) made mortgage loans to households at low interest rates. However, later in the decade nominal interest rates rose sharply as inflation increased. The savings and loans were in trouble: They had to pay high interest rates to attract deposits, but they were earning interest at low rates from the money they had loaned out previously. Many of the S&Ls failed.\nThe government tried to assist the savings and loan industry by broadening the range of investments the industry could make. Some S&Ls soon began aggressively investing in speculative real estate and other risky projects to earn higher returns. Depositors weren’t worried, though, because they knew their savings were insured by the government. Unfortunately, many of these risky projects failed, and the government was forced to bail out the S&Ls at a cost of nearly $100 billion to taxpayers. Because depositors’ savings were insured, most people didn’t suffer directly from the collapse of their savings and loan institutions. As taxpayers they suffered, though, because they had to foot the bill.\nJapan suffered similar problems in the 1990s. By 1995, seven of the eight largest Japanese mortgage lenders had gone bankrupt following a crash in real estate prices. Like the U.S. government, the Japanese government also used taxpayers’ funds to bail these lenders out. The decline in housing prices that we described in the chapter-opening story triggered a severe crisis in the newly developed securitization markets. Although the actual details are complex, the basic story is simple. Lenders had made loans to borrowers who had limited ability to repay, and when borrowers began to miss payments or default on their loans, it caused major disruptions in the market for securitized loans, which, in turn, disrupted credit to other sectors in the economy, causing a massive disruption to financial markets. Even Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac fell victim to the housing decline and were placed under direct government control in September 2008.\nAs the housing-generated financial crisis spread to the rest of the financial markets, the credit markets essentially “froze” and banks worldwide would no longer lend to each other. Customers scrambled to withdraw their funds in financial institutions that they perceived were weak, leading to a “run” on these institutions. As a result, financial institutions such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were forced to close and institutions such as Merrill Lynch and Wachovia Bank were taken over by other financial institutions. When the financial institution Lehman Brothers failed, it set off a panic in the markets that spread to other international banks and financial institutions. The stock market plunged dramatically worldwide, reflecting the severity of the crisis and fear that it would lead to a total worldwide financial collapse. As credit became unavailable, businesses began to suffer as well, as they were not able to borrow funds to run their enterprises on a day-to-day basis. State and local government also found it nearly impossible to borrow at the height of the crisis.\nGovernments around the world took a number of steps to alleviate this crisis. Central banks, whose activities during the crisis are described in more detail in the next chapter, provided loans and credit through a wide variety of channels. After considerable turmoil, the U.S. Congress passed a bailout package, called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, that enabled the Treasury to use up to $700 billion to shore up the financial system. Following the lead of Great Britain, the U.S. Treasury used some of these proceeds to provide funds to large banks in order to restore confidence in the financial system and took limited ownership in these banks. As previously noted, the government took control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and also provided funding to some large financial firms, such as the American International Group (AIG), which provided financial insurance to other firms and was deemed essential to keep afloat during the crisis. The United States and other countries around the world also increased the limits on the amounts eligible for deposit insurance to bolster consumer confidence in banking institutions. The U.S. Congress also enacted the Dodd-Frank legislation, which added a new set of regulatory tools. Similar actions were taken by other large governments around the world. The goals of all these actions were to restore confidence in a system of financial intermediation that was under considerable stress.\nFrom these examples you can see why financial intermediation does not always work. There is a continual debate on the role government should play in investment decisions for the economy and its role in regulating financial intermediaries. Today, some economists and policymakers are carefully reassessing the risks in our complex financial markets.\n\n\n14.4.2 Financial Innovations and New Risks\nAs securitization developed, it allowed financial intermediaries to provide new funds for borrowers to enter the housing market. As the housing boom began in 2002, lenders and home purchasers began to take increasing risks.\nLenders made “subprime” loans to borrowers with limited ability to actually repay their mortgages. Some households were willing to take on considerable debt because they were confident they could make money in a rising housing market.\nLenders securitized the subprime loans and financial firms offered exotic investment securities to investors based on these loans (bundling of subprime loans to reduce (or hide?) the true risk of these financial assets).\nMany financial institutions purchased these securities without really knowing what was inside them. When the housing boom stopped and borrowers stopped making payments on subprime loans, it created panic in the financial market.\nEffectively, through securitization the damage from the subprime loans spread to the entire financial market, causing a major crisis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nIf homeowners owe more on their home mortgages than their home is actually worth, we refer to this as being “underwater”.\nA brief history of financial crises:\nCommercial bank failures in 1930\n\n\nUnprofitable loans to farmer or local businesses\nDepositors panicked which resulted in bank runs where depositors lined up in front of their bank trying to withdraw their deposits.

Ultimately, the usefulness of money rests in exchanging it for goods or services. As the American writer and humorist Ambrose Bierce (1842–1914) wrote in 1911, money is a “blessing that is of no advantage to us excepting when we part with it.” Money is what people regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services, and thus both buyers and sellers must widely accept money. This concept of money is intentionally flexible, because money has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures.",

    "text": "Chapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the various functions of money\nContrast commodity money and fiat money\n\n\n\n\n\n15.1.1 Barter and the Double Coincidence of Wants\nTo understand the usefulness of money, we must consider what the world would be like without money. How would people exchange goods and services? Economies without money typically engage in the barter system. Barter—literally trading one good or service for another—is highly inefficient for trying to coordinate the trades in a modern advanced economy. In an economy without money, an exchange between two people would involve a double coincidence of wants, a situation in which two people each want some good or service that the other person can provide. For example, if an accountant wants a pair of shoes, this accountant must find someone who has a pair of shoes in the correct size and who is willing to exchange the shoes for some hours of accounting services. Such a trade is likely to be difficult to arrange. Think about the complexity of such trades in a modern economy, with its extensive division of labor that involves thousands upon thousands of different jobs and goods.\nAnother problem with the barter system is that it does not allow us to easily enter into future contracts for purchasing many goods and services. For example, if the goods are perishable it may be difficult to exchange them for other goods in the future. Imagine a farmer wanting to buy a tractor in six months using a fresh crop of strawberries. Additionally, while the barter system might work adequately in small economies, it will keep these economies from growing. The time that individuals would otherwise spend producing goods and services and enjoying leisure time they spend bartering.\n\n\n15.1.2 Functions for Money\nMoney solves the problems that the barter system creates. (We will get to its definition soon.) First, money serves as a medium of exchange, which means that money acts as an intermediary between the buyer and the seller. Instead of exchanging accounting services for shoes, the accountant now exchanges accounting services for money. The accountant then uses this money to buy shoes. To serve as a medium of exchange, people must widely accept money as a method of payment in the markets for goods, labor, and financial capital.\nSecond, money must serve as a store of value. In a barter system, we saw the example of the shoemaker trading shoes for accounting services. However, she risks having her shoes go out of style, especially if she keeps them in a warehouse for future use—their value will decrease with each season. Shoes are not a good store of value. Holding money is a much easier way of storing value. You know that you do not need to spend it immediately because it will still hold its value the next day, or the next year. This function of money does not require that money is a perfect store of value. In an economy with inflation, money loses some buying power each year, but it remains money.\nThird, money serves as a unit of account, which means that it is the ruler by which we measure values. For example, an accountant may charge $100 to file your tax return. That $100 can purchase two pair of shoes at $50 a pair. Money acts as a common denominator, an accounting method that simplifies thinking about trade-offs.\nFinally, another function of money is that it must serve as a standard of deferred payment. This means that if money is usable today to make purchases, it must also be acceptable to make purchases today that the purchaser will pay in the future. Loans and future agreements are stated in monetary terms and the standard of deferred payment is what allows us to buy goods and services today and pay in the future. Thus, money serves all of these functions— it is a medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account, and standard of deferred payment.\n\n\n15.1.3 Commodity versus Fiat Money\nMoney has taken a wide variety of forms in different cultures. People have used gold, silver, cowrie shells, cigarettes, and even cocoa beans as money. Although we use these items as commodity money, they also have a value from use as something other than money. For example, people have used gold throughout the ages as money although today we do not use it as money but rather value it for its other attributes. Gold is a good conductor of electricity and the electronics and aerospace industry use it. Other industries use gold too, such as to manufacture energy efficient reflective glass for skyscrapers and is used in the medical industry as well. Of course, gold also has value because of its beauty and malleability in creating jewelry.\nAs commodity money, gold has historically served its purpose as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and as a unit of account. Commodity-backed currencies are dollar bills or other currencies with values backed up by gold or other commodities held at a bank. During much of its history, gold and silver backed the money supply in the United States. Interestingly, antique dollars dated as late as 1957, have “Silver Certificate” printed over the portrait of George Washington, as Figure 15.1 shows. This meant that the holder could take the bill to the appropriate bank and exchange it for a dollar’s worth of silver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Until 1958, silver certificates were commodity-backed money—backed by silver, as indicated by the words “Silver Certificate” printed on the bill. Today, The Federal Reserve backs U.S. bills, but as fiat money (inconvertible paper money made legal tender by a government decree). (Credit: “The.Comedian”/Flickr Creative Commons)\n\n\n\nAs economies grew and became more global in nature, the use of commodity monies became more cumbersome. Countries moved towards the use of fiat money. Fiat money has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be a country's legal tender. The United States’ paper money, for example, carries the statement: “THIS NOTE IS LEGAL TENDER FOR ALL DEBTS, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE.” In other words, by government decree, if you owe a debt, then legally speaking, you can pay that debt with the U.S. currency, even though it is not backed by a commodity. The only backing of our money is universal faith and trust that the currency has value, and nothing more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nMoney is what people in a society regularly use when purchasing or selling goods and services. If money were not available, people would need to barter with each other, meaning that each person would need to identify others with whom they have a double coincidence of wants—that is, each party has a specific good or service that the other desires.\nMoney serves several functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account, a store of value, and a standard of deferred payment. There are two types of money: commodity money, which is an item used as money, but which also has value from its use as something other than money; and fiat money, which has no intrinsic value, but is declared by a government to be the country's legal tender.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the four functions that money serves?\nHow does the existence of money simplify the process of buying and selling?\nWhat is the double-coincidence of wants?",

    "text": "15.2 Measuring Money: Currency, M1 and M2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nContrast M1 money supply and M2 money supply\nClassify monies as M1 money supply or M2 money supply\n\n\n\nCash in your pocket certainly serves as money; however, what about checks or credit cards? Are they money, too? Rather than trying to state a single way of measuring money, economists offer broader definitions of money based on liquidity. Liquidity refers to how quickly you can use a financial asset to buy a good or service. For example, cash is very liquid. You can use your $10 bill easily to buy a hamburger at lunchtime. However, $10 that you have in your savings account is not so easy to use. You must go to the bank or ATM machine and withdraw that cash to buy your lunch. Thus, $10 in your savings account is less liquid.\nThe Federal Reserve Bank, which is the central bank of the United States, is a bank regulator and is responsible for monetary policy and defines money according to its liquidity. There are two definitions of money: M1 and M2 money supply. Historically, M1 money supply included those monies that are very liquid such as cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and traveler’s checks, while M2 money supply included those monies that are less liquid in nature; M2 included M1 plus savings and time deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds. Beginning in May 2020, the Federal Reserve changed the definition of both M1 and M2. The biggest change is that savings moved to be part of M1. M1 money supply now includes cash, checkable (demand) deposits, and savings. M2 money supply is now measured as M1 plus time deposits, certificates of deposits, and money market funds.\nM1 money supply includes coins and currency in circulation—the coins and bills that circulate in an economy that the U.S. Treasury does not hold at the Federal Reserve Bank, or in bank vaults. Closely related to currency are checkable deposits, also known as demand deposits. These are the amounts held in checking accounts. They are called demand deposits or checkable deposits because the banking institution must give the deposit holder his money “on demand” when the customer writes a check or uses a debit card. These items together—currency, and checking accounts in banks—comprise the definition of money known as M1, which the Federal Reserve System measures daily.\nAs mentioned, M1 now includes savings deposits in banks, which are bank accounts on which you cannot write a check directly, but from which you can easily withdraw the money at an automatic teller machine or bank.\nA broader definition of money, M2 includes everything in M1 but also adds other types of deposits. Many banks and other financial institutions also offer a chance to invest in money market funds, where they pool together the deposits of many individual investors and invest them in a safe way, such as short-term government bonds. Another ingredient of M2 are the relatively small (that is, less than about $100,000) certificates of deposit (CDs) or time deposits, which are accounts that the depositor has committed to leaving in the bank for a certain period of time, ranging from a few months to a few years, in exchange for a higher interest rate. In short, all these types of M2 are money that you can withdraw and spend, but which require a greater effort to do so than the items in M1.\nFigure 15.2 should help in visualizing the relationship between M1 and M2. Note that M1 is included in the M2 calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.2: M1 and M2 money have several definitions, ranging from narrow to broad. M1 = coins and currency in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + traveler’s checks. M2 = M1 + savings deposits + money market funds + certificates of deposit + other time deposits.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is responsible for tracking the amounts of M1 and M2 and prepares a weekly release of information about the money supply. To provide an idea of what these amounts sound like, according to the Federal Reserve Bank’s measure of the U.S. money stock, at the end of February 2015, M1 in the United States was $3 trillion, while M2 was $11.8 trillion.\nTable Table 15.1 provides more recent figures and a breakdown of the portion of each type of money that comprised M1 and M2 in October 2021, as provided by the Federal Reserve Bank.\n\n\n\nTable 15.1: M1 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Money Stock Measures(Source: Federal Reserve Statistical Release, http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/h6/current/default.htm#t2tg1link)\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of M1 in the U.S. (October 2018)\n$ billions\n\n\n\n\nCurrency held by the public\n$2,065 billion\n\n\nDemand deposits\n$4,002 billion\n\n\nSavings and other liquid deposits\n$12,154 billion\n\n\nTotal of M1\n$19,221 billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 15.2: M2 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, Money Stock Measures(Source: Federal Reserve Statistical Release, http://www.federalreserve.gov/RELEASES/h6/current/default.htm#t2tg1link)\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents of M2 in the U.S. (October 2018)\n$ billions\n\n\n\n\nM1\n$19,221 billion\n\n\nMoney market retail funds\n$1,027 billion\n\n\nSmall time deposits\n$120 billion\n\n\nTotal of M2\n\\(\\approx\\) $20,000 billion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lines separating M1 and M2 can become a little blurry. Sometimes businesses do not treat elements of M1 alike. For example, some businesses will not accept personal checks for large amounts, but will accept traveler’s checks or cash. Changes in banking practices and technology have made the savings accounts in M2 more similar to the checking accounts in M1. For example, some savings accounts will allow depositors to write checks, use automatic teller machines, and pay bills over the internet, which has made it easier to access savings accounts. As with many other economic terms and statistics, the important point is to know the strengths and limitations of the various definitions of money, not to believe that such definitions are as clear-cut to economists as, say, the definition of nitrogen is to chemists.\nWhere does “plastic money” like debit cards, credit cards, and smart money fit into this picture? A debit card, like a check, is an instruction to the user’s bank to transfer money directly and immediately from your bank account to the seller. It is important to note that in our definition of money, it is checkable deposits that are money, not the paper check or the debit card. Although you can make a purchase with a credit card, the financial institution does not consider it money but rather a short term loan from the credit card company to you. When you make a credit card purchase, the credit card company immediately transfers money from its checking account to the seller, and at the end of the month, the credit card company sends you a bill for what you have charged that month. Until you pay the credit card bill, you have effectively borrowed money from the credit card company. With a smart card, you can store a certain value of money on the card and then use the card to make purchases. Some “smart cards” used for specific purposes, like long-distance phone calls or making purchases at a campus bookstore and cafeteria, are not really all that smart, because you can only use them for certain purchases or in certain places.\nIn short, credit cards, debit cards, and smart cards are different ways to move money when you make a purchase. However, having more credit cards or debit cards does not change the quantity of money in the economy, any more than printing more checks increases the amount of money in your checking account.\nOne key message underlying this discussion of M1 and M2 is that money in a modern economy is not just paper bills and coins. Instead, money is closely linked to bank accounts. The banking system largely conducts macroeconomic policies concerning money. The next section explains how banks function and how a nation’s banking system has the power to create money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nWe measure money with several definitions: - M1 includes currency and money in checking accounts (demand deposits) and savings accounts. - Traveler’s checks are also a component of M1, but are declining in use.\nM2 includes all of M1, plus time deposits like certificates of deposit, and money market funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat components of money do we count as part of M1?\nWhat components of money do we count in M2?\nFor the following list of items, indicate if they are in M1, M2, or neither:\na.

    "text": "15.3 The Role of Banks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain how banks act as intermediaries between savers and borrowers\nEvaluate the relationship between banks, savings and loans, and credit unions\nAnalyze the causes of bankruptcy and recessions\n\n\n\nSomebody once asked the late bank robber named Willie Sutton why he robbed banks. He answered: “That’s where the money is.” While this may have been true at one time, from the perspective of modern economists, Sutton is both right and wrong. He is wrong because the overwhelming majority of money in the economy is not in the form of currency sitting in vaults or drawers at banks, waiting for a robber to appear. Most money is in the form of bank accounts, which exist only as electronic records on computers. From a broader perspective, however, the bank robber was more right than he may have known. Banking is intimately interconnected with money and consequently, with the broader economy.\nBanks make it far easier for a complex economy to carry out the extraordinary range of transactions that occur in goods, labor, and financial capital markets. Imagine for a moment what the economy would be like if everybody had to make all payments in cash. When shopping for a large purchase or going on vacation you might need to carry hundreds of dollars in a pocket or purse. Even small businesses would need stockpiles of cash to pay workers and to purchase supplies. A bank allows people and businesses to store this money in either a checking account or savings account, for example, and then withdraw this money as needed through the use of a direct withdrawal, writing a check, or using a debit card.\nBanks are a critical intermediary in what we call the payment system, which helps an economy exchange goods and services for money or other financial assets. Also, those with extra money that they would like to save can store their money in a bank rather than look for an individual who is willing to borrow it from them and then repay them at a later date. Those who want to borrow money can go directly to a bank rather than trying to find someone to lend them cash. Transaction costs are the costs associated with finding a lender or a borrower for this money. Thus, banks lower transactions costs and act as financial intermediaries—they bring savers and borrowers together. Along with making transactions much safer and easier, banks also play a key role in creating money.\n\n15.3.1 Banks as Financial Intermediaries\nAn “intermediary” is one who stands between two other parties. Banks are a financial intermediary—that is, an institution that operates between a saver who deposits money in a bank and a borrower who receives a loan from that bank. Financial intermediaries include other institutions in the financial market such as insurance companies and pension funds, but we will not include them in this discussion because they are not depository institutions, which are institutions that accept money deposits and then use these to make loans. All the deposited funds mingle in one big pool, which the financial institution then lends. Figure 15.3 illustrates the position of banks as financial intermediaries, with deposits flowing into a bank and loans flowing out. Of course, when banks make loans to firms, the banks will try to funnel financial capital to healthy businesses that have good prospects for repaying the loans, not to firms that are suffering losses and may be unable to repay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: Banks act as financial intermediaries because they stand between savers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money. Borrowers receive loans from banks and repay the loans with interest. In turn, banks return money to savers in the form of withdrawals, which also include interest payments from banks to savers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHOW ARE BANKS, SAVINGS AND LOANS, AND CREDIT UNIONS RELATED?\nBanks have a couple of close cousins: savings institutions and credit unions. Banks, as we explained, receive deposits from individuals and businesses and make loans with the money. Savings institutions are also sometimes called “savings and loans” or “thrifts.” They also take loans and make deposits. However, from the 1930s until the 1980s, federal law limited how much interest savings institutions were allowed to pay to depositors. They were also required to make most of their loans in the form of housing-related loans, either to homebuyers or to real-estate developers and builders.\nA credit union is a nonprofit financial institution that its members own and run. Members of each credit union decide who is eligible to be a member. Usually, potential members would be everyone in a certain community, or groups of employees, or members of a certain organization. The credit union accepts deposits from members and focuses on making loans back to its members. While there are more credit unions than banks and more banks than savings and loans, the total assets of credit unions are growing.\nIn 2008, there were 7,085 banks. Due to the bank failures of 2007–2009 and bank mergers, there were 5,571 banks in the United States at the end of the fourth quarter in 2014. According to the Credit Union National Association, as of December 2014 there were 6,535 credit unions with assets totaling $1.1 billion. A day of “Transfer Your Money” took place in 2009 out of general public disgust with big bank bailouts. People were encouraged to transfer their deposits to credit unions. This has grown into the ongoing Move Your Money Project. Consequently, some now hold deposits as large as $50 billion. However, as of 2013, the 12 largest banks (0.2%) controlled 69 percent of all banking assets, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\n\n15.3.2 A Bank's Balance Sheet\nA balance sheet is an accounting tool that lists assets and liabilities. An asset is something of value that you own and you can use to produce something. For example, you can use the cash you own to pay your tuition. If you own a home, this is also an asset. A liability is a debt or something you owe. Many people borrow money to buy homes. In this case, a home is the asset, but the mortgage is the liability. The net worth is the asset value minus how much is owed (the liability). A bank’s balance sheet operates in much the same way. A bank’s net worth as bank capital. We also refer to a bank has assets such as cash held in its vaults, monies that the bank holds at the Federal Reserve bank (called “reserves”), loans that it makes to customers, and bonds.\nFigure 15.4 illustrates a hypothetical and simplified balance sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank. Because of the two-column format of the balance sheet, with the T-shape formed by the vertical line down the middle and the horizontal line under “Assets” and “Liabilities,” we sometimes call it a T-account.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: A Balance Sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank\n\n\n\nThe “T” in a T-account separates the assets of a firm, on the left, from its liabilities, on the right. All firms use T-accounts, though most are much more complex. For a bank, the assets are the financial instruments that either the bank is holding (its reserves) or those instruments where other parties owe money to the bank—like loans made by the bank and U.S. Government Securities, such as U.S. treasury bonds purchased by the bank. Liabilities are what the bank owes to others. Specifically, the bank owes any deposits made in the bank to those who have made them. The net worth of the bank is the total assets minus total liabilities. Net worth is included on the liabilities side to have the T account balance to zero. For a healthy business, net worth will be positive. For a bankrupt firm, net worth will be negative. In either case, on a bank’s T-account, assets will always equal liabilities plus net worth.\nWhen bank customers deposit money into a checking account, savings account, or a certificate of deposit, the bank views these deposits as liabilities. After all, the bank owes these deposits to its customers, when the customers wish to withdraw their money. In the example in Figure 15.4, the Safe and Secure Bank holds $10 million in deposits.\nLoans are the first category of bank assets in Figure 15.4. Say that a family takes out a 30-year mortgage loan to purchase a house, which means that the borrower will repay the loan over the next 30 years. This loan is clearly an asset from the bank’s perspective, because the borrower has a legal obligation to make payments to the bank over time. However, in practical terms, how can we measure the value of the mortgage loan that the borrower is paying over 30 years in the present? One way of measuring the value of something—whether a loan or anything else—is by estimating what another party in the market is willing to pay for it. Many banks issue home loans, and charge various handling and processing fees for doing so, but then sell the loans to other banks or financial institutions who collect the loan payments. We call the market where financial institutions make loans to borrowers the primary loan market, while the market in which financial institutions buy and sell these loans is the secondary loan market.\nOne key factor that affects what financial institutions are willing to pay for a loan, when they buy it in the secondary loan market, is the perceived riskiness of the loan: that is, given the borrower's characteristics, such as income level and whether the local economy is performing strongly, what proportion of loans of this type will the borrower repay? The greater the risk that a borrower will not repay loan, the less that any financial institution will pay to acquire the loan. Another key factor is to compare the interest rate the financial institution charged on the original loan with the current interest rate in the economy. If the original loan requires the borrower to pay a low interest rate, but current interest rates are relatively high, then a financial institution will pay less to acquire the loan. In contrast, if the original loan requires the borrower to pay a high interest rate, while current interest rates are relatively low, then a financial institution will pay more to acquire the loan. For the Safe and Secure Bank in this example, the total value of its loans if they sold them to other financial institutions in the secondary market is $5 million.\nThe second category of bank asset is bonds, which are a common mechanism for borrowing, used by the federal and local government, and also private companies, and nonprofit organizations. A bank takes some of the money it has received in deposits and uses the money to buy bonds—typically bonds issued that the U.S. government issues. Government bonds are low-risk because the government is virtually certain to pay off the bond, albeit at a low rate of interest. These bonds are an asset for banks in the same way that loans are an asset: The bank will receive a stream of payments in the future. In our example, the Safe and Secure Bank holds bonds worth a total value of $4 million.\nThe final entry under assets is reserves, which is money that the bank keeps on hand, and that it does not lend or invest in bonds—and thus does not lead to interest payments. The Federal Reserve requires that banks keep a certain percentage of depositors’ money on “reserve,” which means either in their vaults or at the Federal Reserve Bank. We call this a reserve requirement. (Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation will explain how the level of these required reserves are one policy tool that governments have to influence bank behavior.) Additionally, banks may also want to keep a certain amount of reserves on hand in excess of what is required. The Safe and Secure Bank is holding $2 million in reserves.\nWe define net worth of a bank as its total assets minus its total liabilities. For the Safe and Secure Bank in Figure 15.4, net worth is equal to $1 million; that is, $11 million in assets minus $10 million in liabilities. For a financially healthy bank, the net worth will be positive. If a bank has negative net worth and depositors tried to withdraw their money, the bank would not be able to give all depositors their money.\n\n\n15.3.3 How Banks Go Bankrupt\nA bank that is bankrupt will have a negative net worth, meaning its assets will be worth less than its liabilities. How can this happen? Again, looking at the balance sheet helps to explain.\nA well-run bank will assume that a small percentage of borrowers will not repay their loans on time, or at all, and factor these missing payments into its planning. Remember, the calculations of the banks' expenses every year include a factor for loans that borrowers do not repay, and the value of a bank’s loans on its balance sheet assumes a certain level of riskiness because some customers will not repay loans. Even if a bank expects a certain number of loan defaults, it will suffer if the number of loan defaults is much greater than expected, as can happen during a recession. For example, if the Safe and Secure Bank in Figure experienced a wave of unexpected defaults, so that its loans declined in value from $5 million to $3 million, then the assets of the Safe and Secure Bank would decline so that the bank had negative net worth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT LED TO THE 2008–2009 FINANCIAL CRISIS?\nMany banks make mortgage loans so that people can buy a home, but then do not keep the loans on their books as an asset. Instead, the bank sells the loan. These loans are “securitized,” which means that they are bundled together into a financial security that a financial institution sells to investors. Investors in these mortgage-backed securities receive a rate of return based on the level of payments that people make on all the mortgages that stand behind the security.\nSecuritization offers certain advantages. If a bank makes most of its loans in a local area, then the bank may be financially vulnerable if the local economy declines, so that many people are unable to make their payments. However, if a bank sells its local loans, and then buys a mortgage-backed security based on home loans in many parts of the country, it can avoid exposure to local financial risks. (In the simple example in the text, banks just own “bonds.” In reality, banks can own a number of financial instruments, as long as these financial investments are safe enough to satisfy the government bank regulators.) From the standpoint of a local homebuyer, securitization offers the benefit that a local bank does not need to have significant extra funds to make a loan, because the bank is only planning to hold that loan for a short time, before selling the loan so that it can pool it into a financial security.\nHowever, securitization also offers one potentially large disadvantage. If a bank plans to hold a mortgage loan as an asset, the bank has an incentive to scrutinize the borrower carefully to ensure that the customer is likely to repay the loan. However, a bank that plans to sell the loan may be less careful in making the loan in the first place. The bank will be more willing to make what we call “subprime loans,” which are loans that have characteristics like low or zero down-payment, little scrutiny of whether the borrower has a reliable income, and sometimes low payments for the first year or two that will be followed by much higher payments. Economists dubbed some financial institutions that made subprime loans in the mid-2000s NINJA loans: loans that financial institutions made even though the borrower had demonstrated No Income, No Job, or Assets.\nFinancial institutions typically sold these subprime loans and turned them into financial securities—but with a twist. The idea was that if losses occurred on these mortgage-backed securities, certain investors would agree to take the first, say, 5% of such losses. Other investors would agree to take, say, the next 5% of losses. By this approach, still other investors would not need to take any losses unless these mortgage-backed financial securities lost 25% or 30% or more of their total value. These complex securities, along with other economic factors, encouraged a large expansion of subprime loans in the mid-2000s.\nThe economic stage was now set for a banking crisis. Banks thought they were buying only ultra-safe securities, because even though the securities were ultimately backed by risky subprime mortgages, the banks only invested in the part of those securities where they were protected from small or moderate levels of losses. However, as housing prices fell after 2007, and the deepening recession made it harder for many people to make their mortgage payments, many banks found that their mortgage-backed financial assets could be worth much less than they had expected—and so the banks were faced with staring bankruptcy. In the 2008–2011 period, 318 banks failed in the United States.\n\n\nThe risk of an unexpectedly high level of loan defaults can be especially difficult for banks because a bank’s liabilities, namely it customers' deposits. Customers can withdraw funds quickly but many of the bank’s assets like loans and bonds will only be repaid over years or even decades. This asset-liability time mismatch—the ability for customers to withdraw bank’s liabilities in the short term while customers repay its assets in the long term—can cause severe problems for a bank. For example, imagine a bank that has loaned a substantial amount of money at a certain interest rate, but then sees interest rates rise substantially. The bank can find itself in a precarious situation. If it does not raise the interest rate it pays to depositors, then deposits will flow to other institutions that offer the higher interest rates that are now prevailing. However, if the bank raises the interest rates that it pays to depositors, it may end up in a situation where it is paying a higher interest rate to depositors than it is collecting from those past loans that it at lower interest rates. Clearly, the bank cannot survive in the long term if it is paying out more in interest to depositors than it is receiving from borrowers.\nHow can banks protect themselves against an unexpectedly high rate of loan defaults and against the risk of an asset-liability time mismatch? One strategy is for a bank to diversify its loans, which means lending to a variety of customers. For example, suppose a bank specialized in lending to a niche market—say, making a high proportion of its loans to construction companies that build offices in one downtown area. If that one area suffers an unexpected economic downturn, the bank will suffer large losses. However, if a bank loans both to consumers who are buying homes and cars and also to a wide range of firms in many industries and geographic areas, the bank is less exposed to risk. When a bank diversifies its loans, those categories of borrowers who have an unexpectedly large number of defaults will tend to be balanced out, according to random chance, by other borrowers who have an unexpectedly low number of defaults. Thus, diversification of loans can help banks to keep a positive net worth. However, if a widespread recession occurs that touches many industries and geographic areas, diversification will not help.\nAlong with diversifying their loans, banks have several other strategies to reduce the risk of an unexpectedly large number of loan defaults. For example, banks can sell some of the loans they make in the secondary loan market, as we described earlier, and instead hold a greater share of assets in the form of government bonds or reserves. Nevertheless, in a lengthy recession, most banks will see their net worth decline because customers will not repay a higher share of loans in tough economic times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nBanks facilitate using money for transactions in the economy because people and firms can use bank accounts when selling or buying goods and services, when paying a worker or receiving payment, and when saving money or receiving a loan.\nIn the financial capital market, banks are financial intermediaries; that is, they operate between savers who supply financial capital and borrowers who demand loans.\nA balance sheet (sometimes called a T-account) is an accounting tool which lists assets in one column and liabilities in another. The bank's liabilities are its deposits. The bank's assets include its loans, its ownership of bonds, and its reserves (which it does not loan out).\nWe calculate a bank's net worth by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. Banks run a risk of negative net worth if the value of their assets declines. The value of assets can decline because of an unexpectedly high number of defaults on loans, or if interest rates rise and the bank suffers an asset-liability time mismatch in which the bank is receiving a low interest rate on its long-term loans but must pay the currently higher market interest rate to attract depositors.\nBanks can protect themselves against these risks by choosing to diversify their loans or to hold a greater proportion of their assets in bonds and reserves. If banks hold only a fraction of their deposits as reserves, then the process of banks’ lending money, re-depositing those loans in banks, and the banks making additional loans will create money in the economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do we call a bank a financial intermediary?\nWhat does a balance sheet show?\nWhat are a bank's assets?

    "text": "15.4 How Banks Create Money\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nUtilize the money multiplier formulate to determine how banks create money\nAnalyze and create T-account balance sheets\nEvaluate the risks and benefits of money and banks\n\n\n\nBanks and money are intertwined. It is not just that most money is in the form of bank accounts. The banking system can literally create money through the process of making loans. Let’s see how.\n\n15.4.1 Money Creation by a Single Bank\nStart with a hypothetical bank called Singleton Bank. The bank has $10 million in deposits. The T-account balance sheet for Singleton Bank, when it holds all of the deposits in its vaults, is in Figure 15.5. At this stage, Singleton Bank is simply storing money for depositors and is using these deposits to make loans. In this simplified example, Singleton Bank cannot earn any interest income from these loans and cannot pay its depositors an interest rate either.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.5: Step 1\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve requires Singleton Bank to keep $1 million on reserve (10% of total deposits). It will loan out the remaining $9 million. By loaning out the $9 million and charging interest, it will be able to make interest payments to depositors and earn interest income for Singleton Bank (for now, we will keep it simple and not put interest income on the balance sheet). Instead of becoming just a storage place for deposits, Singleton Bank can become a financial intermediary between savers and borrowers.\nThis change in business plan alters Singleton Bank’s balance sheet, as Figure 15.6 shows. Singleton’s assets have changed. It now has $1 million in reserves and a loan to Hank’s Auto Supply of $9 million. The bank still has $10 million in deposits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.6: Step 2\n\n\n\nSingleton Bank lends $9 million to Hank’s Auto Supply. The bank records this loan by making an entry on the balance sheet to indicate that it has made a loan. This loan is an asset, because it will generate interest income for the bank. Of course, the loan officer will not allow let Hank to walk out of the bank with $9 million in cash. The bank issues Hank’s Auto Supply a cashier’s check for the $9 million. Hank deposits the loan in his regular checking account with First National. The deposits at First National rise by $9 million and its reserves also rise by $9 million, as Figure 15.7 shows. First National must hold 10% of additional deposits as required reserves but is free to loan out the rest\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.7: Step 3\n\n\n\nMaking loans that are deposited into a demand deposit account increases the M1 money supply. Remember the definition of M1 includes checkable (demand) deposits, which one can easily use as a medium of exchange to buy goods and services. Notice that the money supply is now $19 million: $10 million in deposits in Singleton bank and $9 million in deposits at First National. Obviously as Hank’s Auto Supply writes checks to pay its bills the deposits will draw down. However, the bigger picture is that a bank must hold enough money in reserves to meet its liabilities. The rest the bank loans out. In this example so far, bank lending has expanded the money supply by $9 million.\nNow, First National must hold only 10% as required reserves ($900,000) but can lend out the other 90% ($8.1 million) in a loan to Jack’s Chevy Dealership as Figure 15.8 shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.8: Step 4\n\n\n\nIf Jack’s deposits the loan in its checking account at Second National, the money supply just increased by an additional $8.1 million, as Figure 15.9 shows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.9: Step 5\n\n\n\nHow is this money creation possible? It is possible because there are multiple banks in the financial system, they are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits, and loans end up deposited in other banks, which increases deposits and, in essence, the money supply.\n\n\n15.4.2 The Money Multiplier and a Multi-Bank System\nIn a system with multiple banks, Singleton Bank deposited the initial excess reserve amount that it decided to lend to Hank’s Auto Supply into First National Bank, which is free to loan out $8.1 million. If all banks loan out their excess reserves, the money supply will expand. In a multi-bank system, institutions determine the amount of money that the system can create by using the money multiplier. This tells us by how many times a loan will be “multiplied” as it is spent in the economy and then re-deposited in other banks.\nFortunately, a formula exists for calculating the total of these many rounds of lending in a banking system. The money multiplier formula is:\n\\[\\frac{1}{Reserve Requirement}\\]\nWe then multiply the money multiplier by the change in excess reserves to determine the total amount of M1 money supply created in the banking system. See the Work it Out feature to walk through the multiplier calculation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nUSING THE MONEY MULTIPLIER FORMULA\nUsing the money multiplier for the example in this text:\n\nStep 1.\n\nIn the case of Singleton Bank, for whom the reserve requirement is 10% (or 0.10), the money multiplier is 1 divided by .10, which is equal to 10.\n\nStep 2.\n\nWe have identified that the excess reserves are $9 million, so, using the formula we can determine the total change in the M1 money supply:\nTotal Change in the M1 Money Supply =\n\\(= \\frac{1}{ReserveRequirement} \\times Excess Requirement\\)\n$= 0.10 \\(9 million\\)\n$= 10 \\(9 million\\)\n$= \\(90 million\\)\n\nStep 3.\n\nThus, we can say that, in this example, the total quantity of money generated in this economy after all rounds of lending are completed will be $90 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.4.3 Cautions about the Money Multiplier\nThe money multiplier will depend on the proportion of reserves that the Federal Reserve Band requires banks to hold. Additionally, a bank can also choose to hold extra reserves. Banks may decide to vary how much they hold in reserves for two reasons: macroeconomic conditions and government rules. When an economy is in recession, banks are likely to hold a higher proportion of reserves because they fear that customers are less likely to repay loans when the economy is slow. The Federal Reserve may also raise or lower the required reserves held by banks as a policy move to affect the quantity of money in an economy, as Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation will discuss.\nThe process of how banks create money shows how the quantity of money in an economy is closely linked to the quantity of lending or credit in the economy. All the money in the economy, except for the original reserves, is a result of bank loans that institutions repeatedly re-deposit and loan.\nFinally, the money multiplier depends on people re-depositing the money that they receive in the banking system. If people instead store their cash in safe-deposit boxes or in shoeboxes hidden in their closets, then banks cannot recirculate the money in the form of loans. Central banks have an incentive to assure that bank deposits are safe because if people worry that they may lose their bank deposits, they may start holding more money in cash, instead of depositing it in banks, and the quantity of loans in an economy will decline. Low-income countries have what economists sometimes refer to as “mattress savings,” or money that people are hiding in their homes because they do not trust banks. When mattress savings in an economy are substantial, banks cannot lend out those funds and the money multiplier cannot operate as effectively. The overall quantity of money and loans in such an economy will decline.\n\n\n15.4.4 Money and Banks—Benefits and Dangers\nMoney and banks are marvelous social inventions that help a modern economy to function. Compared with the alternative of barter, money makes market exchanges vastly easier in goods, labor, and financial markets. Banking makes money still more effective in facilitating exchanges in goods and labor markets. Moreover, the process of banks making loans in financial capital markets is intimately tied to the creation of money.\nHowever, the extraordinary economic gains that are possible through money and banking also suggest some possible corresponding dangers. If banks are not working well, it sets off a decline in convenience and safety of transactions throughout the economy. If the banks are under financial stress, because of a widespread decline in the value of their assets, loans may become far less available, which can deal a crushing blow to sectors of the economy that depend on borrowed money like business investment, home construction, and car manufacturing. The 2008–2009 Great Recession illustrated this pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTHE MANY DISGUISES OF MONEY: FROM COWRIES TO BIT COINS\nThe global economy has come a long way since it started using cowrie shells as currency. We have moved away from commodity and commodity-backed paper money to fiat currency. As technology and global integration increases, the need for paper currency is diminishing, too. Every day, we witness the increased use of debit and credit cards.\nThe latest creation and perhaps one of the purest forms of fiat money is the Bitcoin. Bitcoins are a digital currency that allows users to buy goods and services online. Customers can purchase products and services such as videos and books using Bitcoins. This currency is not backed by any commodity nor has any government decreed as legal tender, yet customers use it as a medium of exchange and can store its value (online at least). It is also unregulated by any central bank, but is created online through people solving very complicated mathematics problems and receiving payment afterward. Bitcoin.org is an information source if you are curious. Bitcoins are a relatively new type of money. At present, because it is not sanctioned as a legal currency by any country nor regulated by any central bank, it lends itself for use in illegal as well as legal trading activities. As technology increases and the need to reduce transactions costs associated with using traditional forms of money increases, Bitcoins or some sort of digital currency may replace our dollar bill, just as man replaced the cowrie shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nWe define the money multiplier as the quantity of money that the banking system can generate from each $1 of bank reserves. The formula for calculating the multiplier is 1/reserve ratio, where the reserve ratio is the fraction of deposits that the bank wishes to hold as reserves. The quantity of money in an economy and the quantity of credit for loans are inextricably intertwined. The network of banks making loans, people making deposits, and banks making more loans creates much of the money in an economy.\nGiven the macroeconomic dangers of a malfunctioning banking system, Monetary Policy and Bank Regulation will discuss government policies for controlling the money supply and for keeping the banking system safe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine that you are in the position of buying loans in the secondary market (that is, buying the right to collect the payments on loans) for a bank or other financial services company. Explain why you would be willing to pay more or less for a given loan if:\n\n\nThe borrower has been late on a number of loan payments\nInterest rates in the economy as a whole have risen since the bank made the loan\nThe borrower is a firm that has just declared a high level of profits\nInterest rates in the economy as a whole have fallen since the bank made the loan\n\n\nHow do banks create money?\nWhat is the formula for the money multiplier?\nShould banks have to hold 100% of their deposits? Why or why not?\nExplain what will happen to the money multiplier process if there is an increase in the reserve requirement?\nWhat do you think the Federal Reserve Bank did to the reserve requirement during the 2008–2009 Great Recession?",

    "text": "15.5 The Federal Reserve Banking System and Central Banks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nExplain the structure and organization of the U.S. Federal Reserve\nExplain the balance sheet of the central bank\nDiscuss how central banks impact monetary policy, promote financial stability, and provide banking services\n\n\n\nIn making decisions about the money supply, a central bank decides whether to raise or lower interest rates and, in this way, to influence macroeconomic policy, whose goal is low unemployment and low inflation. The central bank is also responsible for regulating all or part of the nation’s banking system to protect bank depositors and insure the health of the bank’s balance sheet.\nWe call the organization responsible for conducting monetary policy and ensuring that a nation’s financial system operates smoothly the central bank. Most nations have central banks or currency boards. Some prominent central banks around the world include the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England. In the United States, we call the central bank the Federal Reserve—often abbreviated as just “the Fed.” This section explains the U.S. Federal Reserve's organization and identifies the major central bank's responsibilities.\n\n15.5.1 Structure/Organization of the Federal Reserve\nUnlike most central banks, the Federal Reserve is semi-decentralized, mixing government appointees with representation from private-sector banks. At the national level, it is run by a Board of Governors, consisting of seven members appointed by the President of the United States and confirmed by the Senate. Appointments are for 14-year terms and they are arranged so that one term expires January 31 of every even-numbered year. The purpose of the long and staggered terms is to insulate the Board of Governors as much as possible from political pressure so that governors can make policy decisions based only on their economic merits. Additionally, except when filling an unfinished term, each member only serves one term, further insulating decision-making from politics. The Fed's policy decisions do not require congressional approval, and the President cannot ask for a Federal Reserve Governor to resign as the President can with cabinet positions.\nOne member of the Board of Governors is designated as the Chair. For example, from 1987 until early 2006, the Chair was Alan Greenspan. From 2006 until 2014, Ben Bernanke held the post. The current Chair, Janet Yellen, has made many headlines already. Why? See the following Clear It Up feature to find out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHO HAS THE MOST IMMEDIATE ECONOMIC POWER IN THE WORLD?\nChair of the Federal Reserve Board\nThis image is a photograph of Janet Yellen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.10: Janet L. Yellen is the first woman to hold the position of Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. (Credit: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)\n\n\n\nWhat individual can make financial market crash or soar just by making a public statement? It is not Bill Gates or Warren Buffett. It is not even the President of the United States. The answer is the Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In early 2014, Janet L. Yellen, (Figure) became the first woman to hold this post. The media had described Yellen as “perhaps the most qualified Fed chair in history.”\nWith a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University, Yellen has taught macroeconomics at Harvard, the London School of Economics, and most recently at the University of California at Berkeley.\nFrom 2004–2010, Yellen was President of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. Not an ivory tower economist, Yellen became one of the few economists who warned about a possible bubble in the housing market, more than two years before the financial crisis occurred.\nYellen served on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve twice, most recently as Vice Chair. She also spent two years as Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors. If experience and credentials mean anything, Yellen is likely to be an effective Fed chair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe new Chair of the FED.\nThis is an image of the swearing in ceremony of Jerome H. Powell, the new chair of the FED who was appointed by Trump in 2018.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.11: Jerome H. Powell, the new Chair of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\n\n\nJerome H. Powell took office as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 5, 2018, for a four-year term. Mr. Powell also serves as Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the System's principal monetary policymaking body. Mr. Powell has served as a member of the Board of Governors since taking office on May 25, 2012, to fill an unexpired term. He was reappointed to the Board and sworn in on June 16, 2014, for a term ending January 31, 2028.\nPrior to his appointment to the Board, Mr. Powell was a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., where he focused on federal and state fiscal issues. From 1997 through 2005, Mr. Powell was a partner at The Carlyle Group.\nMr. Powell served as an Assistant Secretary and as Undersecretary of the Treasury under President George H.W. Bush, with responsibility for policy on financial institutions, the Treasury debt market, and related areas. Prior to joining the Administration, he worked as a lawyer and investment banker in New York City.\nIn addition to service on corporate boards, Mr. Powell has served on the boards of charitable and educational institutions, including the Bendheim Center for Finance at Princeton University and The Nature Conservancy of Washington, D.C., and Maryland.\nMr. Powell was born in February 1953 in Washington, D.C. He received an AB in politics from Princeton University in 1975 and earned a law degree from Georgetown University in 1979. While at Georgetown, he was editor-in-chief of the Georgetown Law Journal.\nSource of biography: www.federalreserve.gov\n\n\nThe Fed Chair is first among equals on the Board of Governors. While he or she has only one vote, the Chair controls the agenda, and is the Fed's public voice, so he or she has more power and influence than one might expect.\nThe Federal Reserve is more than the Board of Governors. The Fed also includes 12 regional Federal Reserve banks, each of which is responsible for supporting the commercial banks and economy generally in its district. Figure 15.12 shows the Federal Reserve districts and the cities where their regional headquarters are located. The commercial banks in each district elect a Board of Directors for each regional Federal Reserve bank, and that board chooses a president for each regional Federal Reserve district. Thus, the Federal Reserve System includes both federally and private-sector appointed leaders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.12: There are twelve regional Federal Reserve banks, each with its district.\n\n\n\n\n\n15.5.2 Central Bank's Balance Sheet\nThe central bank's balance sheet shows three basic assets:\n\n\nsecurities (mostly treasury securities that it gets through open market operations)\nforeign exchange reserves (typically bonds issued by foreign governments), and\nloans (such as discount loans to meet banks' short-term cash needs).\n\n\nThe first two are needed so that the central bank can perform its function as a government bank and the second are a service to commercial banks.\n\nCentral Bank's Balance Sheet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssets\nLiabilities\n\n\nGovernment's Bank\nSecurities\nCurrency\n\n\nForeign exchange reserves\nGovernment's account\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanker's Bank\nLoans\nAccounts of commercial banks (reserves)\n\n\n\nOn the liabilities side we have:\n\n\nCurrency\nGovernment's account (gov't deposits tax revenue funds)\nCommercial bank accounts (reserves)\n\n\nThe last one, reserves, are the sum of two parts: (i) deposits at the central bank plus (ii) the cash in the commercial bank's own vault. A commercial bank holds reserves for two reasons. First, it has to hold required reserves and second it holds voluntary reserves that are called excess reserves.\n\n\n15.5.3 What Does a Central Bank Do?\nThe Federal Reserve, like most central banks, is designed to perform three important functions:\n\n\nTo conduct monetary policy\nTo promote stability of the financial system\nTo provide banking services to commercial banks and other depository institutions, and to provide banking services to the federal government.\n\n\nThe first two functions are sufficiently important that we will discuss them in their own modules. The third function we will discuss here.\nThe Federal Reserve provides many of the same services to banks as banks provide to their customers. For example, all commercial banks have an account at the Fed where they deposit reserves. Similarly, banks can obtain loans from the Fed through the “discount window” facility, which we will discuss in more detail later. The Fed is also responsible for check processing. When you write a check, for example, to buy groceries, the grocery store deposits the check in its bank account. Then, the grocery store's bank returns the physical check (or an image of that actual check) to your bank, after which it transfers funds from your bank account to the grocery store's account. The Fed is responsible for each of these actions.\nOn a more mundane level, the Federal Reserve ensures that enough currency and coins are circulating through the financial system to meet public demands. For example, each year the Fed increases the amount of currency available in banks around the Christmas shopping season and reduces it again in January.\nFinally, the Fed is responsible for assuring that banks are in compliance with a wide variety of consumer protection laws. For example, banks are forbidden from discriminating on the basis of age, race, sex, or marital status. Banks are also required to disclose publicly information about the loans they make for buying houses and how they distribute the loans geographically, as well as by sex and race of the loan applicants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nThe most prominent task of a central bank is to conduct monetary policy, which involves changes to interest rates and credit conditions, affecting the amount of borrowing and spending in an economy.\nSome prominent central banks around the world include the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of England.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy is it important for the members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve to have longer terms in office than elected officials, like the President?\nHow is a central bank different from a typical commercial bank?\nList the three traditional tools that a central bank has for controlling the money supply.",

    "text": "15.6 Bank Regulation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss the relationship between bank regulation and monetary policy\nExplain bank supervision\nExplain how deposit insurance and lender of last resort are two strategies to protect against bank runs\n\n\n\nA safe and stable national financial system is a critical concern of the Federal Reserve. The goal is not only to protect individuals’ savings, but to protect the integrity of the financial system itself. This esoteric task is usually behind the scenes, but came into view during the 2008–2009 financial crisis, when for a brief period of time, critical parts of the financial system failed and firms became unable to obtain financing for ordinary parts of their business. Imagine if suddenly you were unable to access the money in your bank accounts because your checks were not accepted for payment and your debit cards were declined. This gives an idea of a failure of the payments/financial system.\nBank regulation is intended to maintain banks' solvency by avoiding excessive risk. Regulation falls into a number of categories, including reserve requirements, capital requirements, and restrictions on the types of investments banks may make. In Money and Banking, we learned that banks are required to hold a minimum percentage of their deposits on hand as reserves. “On hand” is a bit of a misnomer because, while a portion of bank reserves are held as cash in the bank, the majority are held in the bank’s account at the Federal Reserve, and their purpose is to cover desired withdrawals by depositors. Another part of bank regulation is restrictions on the types of investments banks are allowed to make. Banks are permitted to make loans to businesses, individuals, and other banks. They can purchase U.S. Treasury securities but, to protect depositors, they are not permitted to invest in the stock market or other assets that are perceived as too risky.\nBank capital is the difference between a bank’s assets and its liabilities. In other words, it is a bank’s net worth. A bank must have positive net worth; otherwise it is insolvent or bankrupt, meaning it would not have enough assets to pay back its liabilities. Regulation requires that banks maintain a minimum net worth, usually expressed as a percent of their assets, to protect their depositors and other creditors.\n\n15.6.1 Bank Supervision\nSeveral government agencies monitor banks' balance sheets to make sure they have positive net worth and are not taking too high a level of risk. Within the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has a national staff of bank examiners who conduct on-site reviews of the 1,500 or so of the largest national banks. The bank examiners also review any foreign banks that have branches in the United States. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency also monitors and regulates about 800 savings and loan institutions.\nThe National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) supervises credit unions, which are nonprofit banks that their members run and own. There are over 6,000 credit unions in the U.S. economy, although the typical credit union is small compared to most banks.\nThe Federal Reserve also has some responsibility for supervising financial institutions. For example, we call conglomerate firms that own banks and other businesses “bank holding companies.” While other regulators like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency supervises the banks, the Federal Reserve supervises the holding companies.\nWhen bank supervision (and bank-like institutions such as savings and loans and credit unions) works well, most banks will remain financially healthy most of the time. If the bank supervisors find that a bank has low or negative net worth, or is making too high a proportion of risky loans, they can require that the bank change its behavior—or, in extreme cases, even force the bank to close or be sold to a financially healthy bank.\nBank supervision can run into both practical and political questions. The practical question is that measuring the value of a bank’s assets is not always straightforward. As we discussed in Money and Banking, a bank’s assets are its loans, and the value of these assets depends on estimates about the risk that customers will not repay these loans. These issues can become even more complex when a bank makes loans to banks or firms in other countries, or arranges financial deals that are much more complex than a basic loan.\nThe political question arises because a bank supervisor's decision to require a bank to close or to change its financial investments is often controversial, and the bank supervisor often comes under political pressure from the bank's owners and the local politicians to keep quiet and back off.\nFor example, many observers have pointed out that Japan’s banks were in deep financial trouble through most of the 1990s; however, nothing substantial had been done about it by the early 2000s. A similar unwillingness to confront problems with struggling banks is visible across the rest of the world, in East Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, Russia, and elsewhere.\nIn the United States, the government passed laws in the 1990s requiring that bank supervisors make their findings open and public, and that they act as soon as they identify a problem. However, as many U.S. banks were staggered by the 2008-2009 recession, critics of the bank regulators asked pointed questions about why the regulators had not foreseen the banks' financial shakiness earlier, before such large losses had a chance to accumulate.\n\n\n15.6.2 Bank Runs\nBack in the nineteenth century and during the first few decades of the twentieth century (around and during the Great Depression), putting your money in a bank could be nerve-wracking. Imagine that the net worth of your bank became negative, so that the bank’s assets were not enough to cover its liabilities. In this situation, whoever withdrew their deposits first received all of their money, and those who did not rush to the bank quickly enough, lost their money. We call depositors racing to the bank to withdraw their deposits, as Figure 15.13 shows a bank run. In the movie It’s a Wonderful Life, the bank manager, played by Jimmy Stewart, faces a mob of worried bank depositors who want to withdraw their money, but manages to allay their fears by allowing some of them to withdraw a portion of their deposits—using the money from his own pocket that was supposed to pay for his honeymoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.13: Bank runs during the Great Depression only served to worsen the economic situation. (Credit: National Archives and Records Administration)\n\n\n\nThe risk of bank runs created instability in the banking system. Even a rumor that a bank might experience negative net worth could trigger a bank run and, in a bank run, even healthy banks could be destroyed. Because a bank loans out most of the money it receives, and because it keeps only limited reserves on hand, a bank run of any size would quickly drain any of the bank’s available cash. When the bank had no cash remaining, it only intensified the fears of remaining depositors that they could lose their money. Moreover, a bank run at one bank often triggered a chain reaction of runs on other banks. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, bank runs were typically not the original cause of a recession—but they could make a recession much worse.\n\n\n15.6.3 Lender of Last Resort\nThe problem with bank runs is not that insolvent banks will fail; they are, after all, bankrupt and need to be shut down. The problem is that bank runs can cause solvent banks to fail and spread to the rest of the financial system. To prevent this, the Fed stands ready to lend to banks and other financial institutions when they cannot obtain funds from anywhere else. This is known as the lender of last resort role. For banks, the central bank acting as a lender of last resort helps to reinforce the effect of deposit insurance and to reassure bank customers that they will not lose their money.\nThe lender of last resort task can arise in other financial crises, as well. During the 1987 stock market crash panic, when U.S. stock values fell by 25% in a single day, the Federal Reserve made a number of short-term emergency loans so that the financial system could keep functioning. During the 2008-2009 recession, we can interpret the Fed's “quantitative easing” policies (discussed below) as a willingness to make short-term credit available as needed in a time when the banking and financial system was under stress.\nWhen the central bank lends funds to the commercial bank at the discount rate, then for the borrowing bank this loan is a liability that is matched by an offsetting increase in the level of its reserve account. For the Fed, the loan is an asset that is created in exchange for a credit to the borrower's reserve account. The extension of credit to the banking system raises the level of reserves and expands the monetary base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nA bank run occurs when there are rumors (possibly true, possibly false) that a bank is at financial risk of having negative net worth. As a result, depositors rush to the bank to withdraw their money and put it someplace safer. Even false rumors, if they cause a bank run, can force a healthy bank to lose its deposits and be forced to close. Deposit insurance guarantees bank depositors that, even if the bank has negative net worth, their deposits will be protected. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) collects deposit insurance premiums from banks and guarantees bank deposits up to $250,000. Bank supervision involves inspecting the balance sheets of banks to make sure that they have positive net worth and that their assets are not too risky. In the United States, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is responsible for supervising banks and inspecting savings and loans and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for inspecting credit unions. The FDIC and the Federal Reserve also play a role in bank supervision.\nWhen a central bank acts as a lender of last resort, it makes short-term loans available in situations of severe financial panic or stress. The failure of a single bank can be treated like any other business failure. Yet if many banks fail, it can reduce aggregate demand in a way that can bring on or deepen a recession. The combination of deposit insurance, bank supervision, and lender of last resort policies help to prevent weaknesses in the banking system from causing recessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the danger of bank runs, why do banks not keep the majority of deposits on hand to meet the demands of depositors?\nBank runs are often described as “self-fulfilling prophecies.” Why is this phrase appropriate to bank runs?\nHow is bank regulation linked to the conduct of monetary policy?\nWhat is a bank run?\nIn a program of deposit insurance as it is operated in the United States, what is being insured and who pays the insurance premiums?\nIn government programs of bank supervision, what is being supervised?\nWhat is the lender of last resort?\nName and briefly describe the responsibilities of each of the following agencies: FDIC, NCUA, and OCC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.1: Until 1958, silver certificates were commodity-backed money—backed by silver, as indicated by the words “Silver Certificate” printed on the bill.

M1 = coins and currency in circulation + checkable (demand) deposit + traveler’s checks. M2 = M1 + savings deposits + money market funds + certificates of deposit + other time deposits.\nFigure 15.3: Banks act as financial intermediaries because they stand between savers and borrowers. Savers place deposits with banks, and then receive interest payments and withdraw money. Borrowers receive loans from banks and repay the loans with interest. In turn, banks return money to savers in the form of withdrawals, which also include interest payments from banks to savers.\nFigure 15.4: A Balance Sheet for the Safe and Secure Bank\nFigure 15.5: Step 1\nFigure 15.6: Step 2\nFigure 15.7: Step 3\nFigure 15.8: Step 4\nFigure 15.9: Step 5\nFigure 15.10: Janet L.

    "text": "16.1 How a Central Bank Executes Monetary Policy\nThe Federal Reserve's most important function is to conduct the nation’s monetary policy. Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power “to coin money” and “to regulate the value thereof.” As part of the 1913 legislation that created the Federal Reserve, Congress delegated these powers to the Fed. Monetary policy involves managing interest rates and credit conditions, which influences the level of economic activity, as we describe in more detail below.\nA central bank has three traditional tools to implement monetary policy in the economy:\nIn discussing how these three tools work, it is useful to think of the central bank as a “bank for banks”—that is, each private-sector bank has its own account at the central bank. As noted, these monetary policy tools are used in an environment of limited reserves. However, since the financial crisis of 2008–2009, also known as the Great Recession, banks have kept what we defined earlier as ample reserves. As such, the FOMC no longer utilizes the limited reserves tools. But, there is nothing that says banks will not return to keeping limited reserves, so understanding how these tools work is still important. We will discuss each of these monetary policy tools in the sections below.",

Since the buildup of excess reserves since 2008, the central bank subsequently abolished reserve requirements in 2020 and started paying interest on reserve balances (the IORB rate).\nBy manipulating the IORB rate directly, the central bank can control the amount of money in the economy.\n\n\nSince the early 1920s, the most common monetary policy tool in the U.S. has been open market operations. These take place when the central bank sells or buys U.S. Treasury bonds in order to influence the quantity of bank reserves and the level of interest rates. The specific interest rate targeted in open market operations is the federal funds rate. The name is a bit of a misnomer since the federal funds rate is the interest rate that commercial banks charge making overnight loans to other banks. As such, it is a very short term interest rate, but one that reflects credit conditions in financial markets very well.\nThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes the decisions regarding these open market operations. The FOMC comprises seven members of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors. It also includes five voting members who the Board draws, on a rotating basis, from the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The New York district president is a permanent FOMC voting member and the Board fills other four spots on a rotating, annual basis, from the other 11 districts. The FOMC typically meets every six weeks, but it can meet more frequently if necessary. The FOMC tries to act by consensus; however, the Federal Reserve's chairman has traditionally played a very powerful role in defining and shaping that consensus. For the Federal Reserve, and for most central banks, open market operations have, over the last few decades, been the most commonly used tool of monetary policy.\nTo understand how open market operations affect the money supply, consider the balance sheet of Happy Bank, displayed in Figure 16.2. Figure 16.2 (a) shows that Happy Bank starts with $460 million in assets, divided among reserves, bonds and loans, and $400 million in liabilities in the form of deposits, with a net worth of $60 million. When the central bank purchases $20 million in bonds from Happy Bank, the bond holdings of Happy Bank fall by $20 million and the bank’s reserves rise by $20 million, as Figure 16.2 (b) shows.\nHowever, Happy Bank only wants to hold $40 million in reserves (the quantity of reserves with which it started in Figure 16.2) (a), so the bank decides to loan out the extra $20 million in reserves and its loans rise by $20 million, as Figure 16.2 (c) shows.\nThe central bank's open market operation causes Happy Bank to make loans instead of holding its assets in the form of government bonds, which expands the money supply. As the new loans are deposited in banks throughout the economy, these banks will, in turn, loan out some of the deposits they receive, triggering the money multiplier that we discussed in Money and Banking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.2: Bank Balance Sheet and Open Market Purchase\n\n\n\nWhere did the Federal Reserve get the $20 million that it used to purchase the bonds? A central bank has the power to create money. In practical terms, the Federal Reserve would write a check to Happy Bank, so that Happy Bank can have that money credited to its bank account at the Federal Reserve. In truth, the Federal Reserve created the money to purchase the bonds out of thin air—or with a few clicks on some computer keys.\nOpen market operations can also reduce the quantity of money and loans in an economy. Figure 16.3 (a) shows the balance sheet of Happy Bank before the central bank sells bonds in the open market. When Happy Bank purchases $30 million in bonds, Happy Bank sends $30 million of its reserves to the central bank, but now holds an additional $30 million in bonds, as Figure 16.3 (b) shows. However, Happy Bank wants to hold $40 million in reserves, as in Figure 16.3 (a), so it will adjust down the quantity of its loans by $30 million, to bring its reserves back to the desired level, as Figure 16.3 (c) shows.\nIn practical terms, a bank can easily reduce its quantity of loans. At any given time, a bank is receiving payments on loans that it made previously and also making new loans. If the bank just slows down or briefly halts making new loans, and instead adds those funds to its reserves, then its overall quantity of loans will decrease. A decrease in the quantity of loans also means fewer deposits in other banks, and other banks reducing their lending as well, as the money multiplier that we discussed in Money and Banking takes effect. What about all those bonds? How do they affect the money supply? Read the following Clear It Up feature for the answer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.3: Bank Balance Sheet and Open Market Sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDOES SELLING OR BUYING BONDS INCREASE THE MONEY SUPPLY?\nIs it a sale of bonds by the central bank which increases bank reserves and lowers interest rates or is it a purchase of bonds by the central bank? The easy way to keep track of this is to treat the central bank as being outside the banking system. When a central bank buys bonds, money is flowing from the central bank to individual banks in the economy, increasing the money supply in circulation.\nWhen a central bank sells bonds, then money from individual banks in the economy is flowing into the central bank—reducing the quantity of money in the economy.\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve was founded in the aftermath of the 1907 Financial Panic when many banks failed as a result of bank runs. As mentioned earlier, since banks make profits by lending out their deposits, no bank, even those that are not bankrupt, can withstand a bank run. As a result of the Panic, the Federal Reserve was founded to be the “lender of last resort.” In the event of a bank run, sound banks, (banks that were not bankrupt) could borrow as much cash as they needed from the Fed’s discount “window” to quell the bank run. We call the interest rate banks pay for such loans the discount rate. (They are so named because the bank makes loans against its outstanding loans “at a discount” of their face value.) Once depositors became convinced that the bank would be able to honor their withdrawals, they no longer had a reason to make a run on the bank. In short, the Federal Reserve was originally intended to provide credit passively, but in the years since its founding, the Fed has taken on a more active role with monetary policy.\n\n\n16.1.2 Changing the Discount Rate\nIn the Federal Reserve Act, the phrase “…to afford means of rediscounting commercial paper” is contained in its long title. This was the main tool for monetary policy when the Fed was initially created. Today, the Federal Reserve has even more tools at its disposal, including quantitative easing, overnight repurchase agreements, and interest on excess reserves. This illustrates how monetary policy has evolved and how it continues to do so.\nThe second traditional method for conducting monetary policy in a limited reserve environment is to raise or lower the discount rate. If the central bank raises the discount rate, then commercial banks will reduce their borrowing of reserves from the Fed, and instead call in loans to replace those reserves. Since fewer loans are available, the money supply falls and market interest rates rise. If the central bank lowers the discount rate it charges to banks, the process works in reverse.\nIn recent decades, the Federal Reserve has made relatively few discount loans. Before a bank borrows from the Federal Reserve to fill out its required reserves, the bank is expected to first borrow from other available sources, like other banks. This is encouraged by the Fed charging a higher discount rate than the federal funds rate. Given that most banks borrow little at the discount rate, changing the discount rate up or down has little impact on their behavior. More importantly, the Fed has found from experience that open market operations are a more precise and powerful means of executing any desired monetary policy.\n\n\n16.1.3 Changing Reserve Requirements\nA potential third method of conducting monetary policy in a limited reserves environment is for the central bank to raise or lower the reserve requirement, which, as we noted earlier, is the percentage of each bank’s deposits that it is legally required to hold either as cash in their vault or on deposit with the central bank. If banks are required to hold a greater amount in reserves, they have less money available to lend out. If banks are allowed to hold a smaller amount in reserves, they will have a greater amount of money available to lend out.\nUntil very recently, the Federal Reserve required banks to hold reserves equal to 0% of the first $14.5 million in deposits, then to hold reserves equal to 3% of the deposits up to $103.6 million, and 10% of any amount above $103.6 million. The Fed makes small changes in the reserve requirements almost every year. For example, the $103.6 million dividing line is sometimes bumped up or down by a few million dollars. Today, these rates are no longer in effect; as of March 2020 (when the pandemic-induced recession hit), the 10% and 3% requirements were reduced to 0%, effectively eliminating the reserve requirement for all depository institutions.\nThe Fed rarely uses large changes in reserve requirements to execute monetary policy; the pandemic was an exception for obvious reasons. Also, a sudden demand that all banks increase their reserves would be extremely disruptive and difficult for them to comply. While loosening requirements too much might create a danger of banks’ inability to meet withdrawal demands, the benefits of reducing the reserve requirements in March 2020 exceeded the risks.\nIn the following section, we will discuss how interest on excess reserves is used as a monetary policy tool.\n\n\n16.1.4 Monetary Policy and Ample Reserves\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nOpen market operations as well as the other instruments mentioned above are not the main monetary policy tool anymore. Since the buildup of excess reserves since 2008, the central bank subsequently abolished reserve requirements in 2020 and started paying interest on reserve balances (the IORB rate).\nBy manipulating the IORB rate directly, the central bank can control the amount of money in the economy.\n\n\nAs we noted previously, banks in the United States have historically had very little reason to keep more than their minimum required reserves because their regional Federal Reserve bank did not pay any interest on those reserves. This behavior changed dramatically during the 2008–2009 financial crisis.\nDuring this period of time, 389 banks failed. The banks that survived responded to the financial crisis by increasing their reserves well beyond their required minimum. Combined with the measures undertaken by the FOMC and the U.S. government to respond to the financial crisis, banks’ reserves increased from around $15 billion in 2007, to $2.7 trillion by late 2014. While reserves did decrease to around $1.7 trillion by 2017, this was no longer an environment of limited reserves, but an environment of ample reserves. In fact, in 2019, the FOMC issued a statement indicating that monetary policy would be based on ample reserves. While it may be a good decision for banks to keep ample reserves, as we know, the banking system facilitates both short-term and long-term economic activity when it makes loans to finance consumption, for business investment and expansion, and to help fund and support innovation, among many other possibilities. In a sense, loans allow for the economy to ultimately become more productive, causing an increase in long-run economic growth. The point is that we need the banking system to be willing to make loans and not just keep ample excess reserves. However, when banks are keeping a trillion or more dollars as excess reserves, these are funds that they are choosing not to lend out, potentially causing the economy to grow at a slower rate than it otherwise might.\nHow then can the FOMC incentivize banks to lend out these excess reserves? This is where the interest rate on reserve balances (IORB) comes in. The IORB is the interest rate paid to banks for their holdings of excess reserves. Congress granted the Federal Reserve the ability to pay this interest in 2006. The policy was originally slated to begin in 2011, but the financial crisis accelerated its start date to 2008. (For a few years there were two separate rates, the interest rate on required reserves and the interest rate on excess reserves, but these two were combined into the IORB in 2021.) The FOMC controls the IORB directly. It sets the IORB at whatever rate it chooses, based on macroeconomic conditions and forecasts.\nWe can now explore how the IORB may affect banks’ decisions to hold more or fewer excess reserves. As we noted in our discussion of open market operations, the federal funds rate (FFR) is the specific interest rate targeted by the FOMC. The federal funds market is where banks borrow and lend their excess reserves from one another over a very short period of time, often described as overnight. It is a market, as we explained in Demand and Supply, with supply, demand, and a price. In the federal funds market, you can think of the FFR as the price a bank gets paid for lending (or selling) excess reserves in the federal funds market, and you can think of the FFR as the price a bank pays for borrowing (or buying) those excess reserves. The FFR is targeted by the FOMC because as the FFR increases and decreases, most other interest rates eventually increase or decrease too. In Monetary Policy and Economic Outcomes, we’ll show how changes in interest rates affect the macroeconomy.\nTo illustrate how changes in the IORB can affect the FFR, assume that the IORB is 2%, which means that a bank can earn 2% on its excess reserves, free of risk. Because in the federal funds market, the lending period is often very short-term, sometimes even shorter than one day, those loans are nearly risk-free. As a result, most banks view the IORB as a very close alternative to the FFR. If the FFR also pays 2% interest, generally, a bank will be indifferent to where it keeps its excess reserves.\nLet’s say that macroeconomic conditions convince the FOMC to lower the FFR. To do this, it will lower the IORB. Let’s see why. If the IORB decreases to 1.75%, banks will generally choose to reduce their excess reserves holdings at their regional Federal Reserve bank and instead lend those excess reserves in the federal funds market in order to earn the currently higher FFR of 2%. But this increase in the supply of excess reserves in the federal funds market will act to lower the price in the federal funds market, which is the FFR.\nWhen the FOMC lowers the IORB, it also tends to lower the discount rate at the same time. Some banks could then engage in arbitrage, which is the simultaneous (or near-simultaneous) purchase and sale of a good to profit from a difference in the price of that good across markets. In our example, if the discount rate also decreases from 2% to 1.75%, a bank could borrow excess reserves from the Federal Reserve at the 1.75% discount rate and then lend those same excess reserves in the federal funds market at 2%, earning $0.0025 on every $1.00 borrowed. (This may not seem like much, but multiply this by $1 million or $10 million and it adds up quickly.) But this arbitrage activity also ensures that the FFR will decrease as the FOMC desires because the increase in the supply of excess reserves will cause the FFR to decrease, and as banks leave the federal funds market to borrow from the Federal Reserve, the decrease in the demand for excess reserves will cause the FFR to decrease too.\nAlternatively, let’s say that macroeconomic conditions convince the FOMC to raise the FFR. If the FOMC increases the IORB to 2.25%, banks will then choose to keep more excess reserves at their regional Federal Reserve bank and earn the higher IORB. This decrease in supply in the federal funds market will cause the FFR to increase as well.\nArbitrage will also ensure that the FFR increases. As the IORB increases, banks will borrow more excess reserves in the federal funds market and deposit them with their regional Federal Reserve bank in order to earn a profit on the difference between the IORB and the FFR. This increase in demand will then cause the FFR to increase as well.\n\n\n16.1.5 Quantitative Easing\nThe most powerful and commonly used of the three traditional tools of monetary policy—open market operations—works by expanding or contracting the money supply in a way that influences the interest rate. In late 2008, as the U.S. economy struggled with recession, the Federal Reserve had already reduced the interest rate to near-zero. With the recession still ongoing, the Fed decided to adopt an innovative and nontraditional policy known as quantitative easing (QE). This is the purchase of long-term government and private mortgage-backed securities by central banks to make credit available so as to stimulate aggregate demand.\nQuantitative easing differed from traditional monetary policy in several key ways. First, it involved the Fed purchasing long term Treasury bonds, rather than short term Treasury bills. In 2008, however, it was impossible to stimulate the economy any further by lowering short term rates because they were already as low as they could get. (Read the closing Bring it Home feature for more on this.) Therefore, Chairman Bernanke sought to lower long-term rates utilizing quantitative easing.\nThis leads to a second way QE is different from traditional monetary policy. Instead of purchasing Treasury securities, the Fed also began purchasing private mortgage-backed securities, something it had never done before. During the financial crisis, which precipitated the recession, mortgage-backed securities were termed “toxic assets,” because when the housing market collapsed, no one knew what these securities were worth, which put the financial institutions which were holding those securities on very shaky ground. By offering to purchase mortgage-backed securities, the Fed was both pushing long term interest rates down and also removing possibly “toxic assets” from the balance sheets of private financial firms, which would strengthen the financial system.\nQuantitative easing (QE) occurred in three episodes:\n\n\nDuring QE1, which began in November 2008, the Fed purchased $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities from government enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nIn November 2010, the Fed began QE2, in which it purchased $600 billion in U.S. Treasury bonds.\nQE3, began in September 2012 when the Fed commenced purchasing $40 billion of additional mortgage-backed securities per month. This amount was increased in December 2012 to $85 billion per month. The Fed stated that, when economic conditions permit, it will begin tapering (or reducing the monthly purchases). By October 2014, the Fed had announced the final $15 billion bond purchase, ending Quantitative Easing.\n\n\nWe usually think of the quantitative easing policies that the Federal Reserve adopted (as did other central banks around the world) as temporary emergency measures. If these steps are to be temporary, then the Federal Reserve will need to stop making these additional loans and sell off the financial securities it has accumulated. The concern is that the process of quantitative easing may prove more difficult to reverse than it was to enact. The evidence suggests that QE1 was somewhat successful, but that QE2 and QE3 have been less so.\nFast forward to March 2020, when the Fed under the leadership of Jerome Powell promised another round of asset purchases which was dubbed by some as “QE4,” intended once again to provide liquidity to a distressed financial system in the wake of the pandemic. This round was much faster, increasing Fed assets by $2 trillion in just a few months. Recently, the Fed has begun to slow down the purchase of these assets once again through a taper, and the pace of the tapering is expected to increase through 2022. But as of the end of 2021, total Fed assets exceed $8 trillion, compared to $4 trillion in February 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nA central bank has three traditional tools to conduct monetary policy: open market operations, which involves buying and selling government bonds with banks; reserve requirements, which determine what level of reserves a bank is legally required to hold; and discount rates, which is the interest rate charged by the central bank on the loans that it gives to other commercial banks. The most commonly used tool is open market operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the central bank sells $500 in bonds to a bank that has issued $10,000 in loans and is exactly meeting the reserve requirement of 10%, what will happen to the amount of loans and to the money supply in general?\nWhat would be the effect of increasing the banks' reserve requirements on the money supply?\nExplain how to use an open market operation to expand the money supply.\nExplain how to use the reserve requirement to expand the money supply.\nExplain how to use the discount rate to expand the money supply.",

Conversely, a monetary policy that raises interest rates and reduces borrowing in the economy is a contractionary monetary policy or tight monetary policy.\nThis module will discuss how expansionary and contractionary monetary policies affect interest rates and aggregate demand, and how such policies will affect macroeconomic goals like unemployment and inflation. We will conclude with a look at the Fed’s monetary policy practice in recent decades.\n\n16.2.1 The Effect of Monetary Policy on Interest Rates\nConsider the market for loanable bank funds in Figure 16.4. The original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an 8% interest rate and a quantity of funds loaned and borrowed of $10 billion.\nAn expansionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to S1, leading to an equilibrium (E1) with a lower 6% interest rate and a quantity $14 billion in loaned funds. Conversely, a contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to S2, leading to an equilibrium (E2) with a higher 10% interest rate and a quantity of $8 billion in loaned funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.4: The original equilibrium occurs at E0. An expansionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the right from the original supply curve (S0) to the new supply curve (S1) and to a new equilibrium of E1, reducing the interest rate from 8% to 6%. A contractionary monetary policy will shift the supply of loanable funds to the left from the original supply curve (S0) to the new supply (S2), and raise the interest rate from 8% to 10%.\n\n\n\nHow does a central bank “raise” interest rates? When describing the central bank's monetary policy actions, it is common to hear that the central bank “raised interest rates” or “lowered interest rates.” We need to be clear about this: more precisely, through open market operations the central bank changes bank reserves in a way which affects the supply curve of loanable funds. As a result, Figure 16.4 shows that interest rates change. If they do not meet the Fed’s target, the Fed can supply more or less reserves until interest rates do.\nRecall that the specific interest rate the Fed targets is the federal funds rate. The Federal Reserve has, since 1995, established its target federal funds rate in advance of any open market operations.\nOf course, financial markets display a wide range of interest rates, representing borrowers with different risk premiums and loans that they must repay over different periods of time. In general, when the federal funds rate drops substantially, other interest rates drop, too, and when the federal funds rate rises, other interest rates rise. However, a fall or rise of one percentage point in the federal funds rate—which remember is for borrowing overnight—will typically have an effect of less than one percentage point on a 30-year loan to purchase a house or a three-year loan to purchase a car. Monetary policy can push the entire spectrum of interest rates higher or lower, but the forces of supply and demand in those specific markets for lending and borrowing set the specific interest rates.\n\n\n16.2.2 The Effect of Monetary Policy on Aggregate Demand\nMonetary policy affects interest rates and the available quantity of loanable funds, which in turn affects several components of aggregate demand. Tight or contractionary monetary policy that leads to higher interest rates and a reduced quantity of loanable funds will reduce two components of aggregate demand. Business investment will decline because it is less attractive for firms to borrow money, and even firms that have money will notice that, with higher interest rates, it is relatively more attractive to put those funds in a financial investment than to make an investment in physical capital. In addition, higher interest rates will discourage consumer borrowing for big-ticket items like houses and cars. Conversely, loose or expansionary monetary policy that leads to lower interest rates and a higher quantity of loanable funds will tend to increase business investment and consumer borrowing for big-ticket items.\nIf the economy is suffering a recession and high unemployment, with output below potential GDP, expansionary monetary policy can help the economy return to potential GDP.\nFigure 16.5 (a) illustrates this situation. This example uses a short-run upward-sloping Keynesian aggregate supply curve (SRAS). The original equilibrium during a recession of E0 occurs at an output level of 600. An expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and stimulate investment and consumption spending, causing the original aggregate demand curve (AD0) to shift right to AD1, so that the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.5: In panel (a) the economy is originally in a recession with the equilibrium output and price shown at E0. Expansionary monetary policy will reduce interest rates and shift aggregate demand to the right from AD0 to AD1, leading to the new equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of output with a relatively small rise in the price level. (b) The economy is originally producing above the potential GDP level of output at the equilibrium E0 and is experiencing pressures for an inflationary rise in the price level. Contractionary monetary policy will shift aggregate demand to the left from AD0 to AD1, thus leading to a new equilibrium (E1) at the potential GDP level of output.\n\n\n\nConversely, if an economy is producing at a quantity of output above its potential GDP, a contractionary monetary policy can reduce the inflationary pressures for a rising price level. In Figure 16.5 (b), the original equilibrium (E0) occurs at an output of 750, which is above potential GDP. A contractionary monetary policy will raise interest rates, discourage borrowing for investment and consumption spending, and cause the original demand curve (AD0) to shift left to AD1, so that the new equilibrium (E1) occurs at the potential GDP level of 700.\nThese examples suggest that monetary policy should be countercyclical; that is, it should act to counterbalance the business cycles of economic downturns and upswings. The Fed should loosen monetary policy when a recession has caused unemployment to increase and tighten it when inflation threatens. Of course, countercyclical policy does pose a danger of overreaction. If loose monetary policy seeking to end a recession goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the right that it triggers inflation. If tight monetary policy seeking to reduce inflation goes too far, it may push aggregate demand so far to the left that a recession begins. Figure (a) summarizes the chain of effects that connect loose and tight monetary policy to changes in output and the price level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.6: In Panel (a) expansionary monetary policy by the central bank causes the supply of money and loanable funds to increase, which lowers the interest rate, stimulating additional borrowing for investment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand right. The result is a higher price level and, at least in the short run, higher real GDP. (b) In contractionary monetary policy, the central bank causes the supply of money and credit in the economy to decrease, which raises the interest rate, discouraging borrowing for investment and consumption, and shifting aggregate demand left. The result is a lower price level and, at least in the short run, lower real GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n16.2.3 Federal Reserve Actions Over Last Four Decades\nFor the period from the mid-1970s up through the end of 2007, we can summarize Federal Reserve monetary policy by looking at how it targeted the federal funds interest rate using open market operations.\nOf course, telling the story of the U.S. economy since 1975 in terms of Federal Reserve actions leaves out many other macroeconomic factors that were influencing unemployment, recession, economic growth, and inflation over this time. The nine episodes of Federal Reserve action outlined in the sections below also demonstrate that we should consider the central bank as one of the leading actors influencing the macro economy. As we noted earlier, the single person with the greatest power to influence the U.S. economy is probably the Federal Reserve chairperson.\nFigure 16.7 shows how the Federal Reserve has carried out monetary policy by targeting the federal funds interest rate in the last few decades. The graph shows the federal funds interest rate (remember, this interest rate is set through open market operations), the unemployment rate, and the inflation rate since 1975. Different episodes of monetary policy during this period are indicated in the figure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.7: Through the episodes here, the Federal Reserve typically reacted to higher inflation with a contractionary monetary policy and a higher interest rate, and reacted to higher unemployment with an expansionary monetary policy and a lower interest rate.\n\n\n\n\nEpisode 1\n\nConsider Episode 1 in the late 1970s. The rate of inflation was very high, exceeding 10% in 1979 and 1980, so the Federal Reserve used tight monetary policy to raise interest rates, with the federal funds rate rising from 5.5% in 1977 to 16.4% in 1981. By 1983, inflation was down to 3.2%, but aggregate demand contracted sharply enough that back-to-back recessions occurred in 1980 and in 1981–1982, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.8% in 1979 to 9.7% in 1982.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nIn Episode 2, when economists persuaded the Federal Reserve in the early 1980s that inflation was declining, the Fed began slashing interest rates to reduce unemployment. The federal funds interest rate fell from 16.4% in 1981 to 6.8% in 1986. By 1986 or so, inflation had fallen to about 2% and the unemployment rate had come down to 7%, and was still falling.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nHowever, in Episode 3 in the late 1980s, inflation appeared to be creeping up again, rising from 2% in 1986 up toward 5% by 1989. In response, the Federal Reserve used contractionary monetary policy to raise the federal funds rates from 6.6% in 1987 to 9.2% in 1989. The tighter monetary policy stopped inflation, which fell from above 5% in 1990 to under 3% in 1992, but it also helped to cause the 1990-1991 recession, and the unemployment rate rose from 5.3% in 1989 to 7.5% by 1992.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nIn Episode 4, in the early 1990s, when the Federal Reserve was confident that inflation was back under control, it reduced interest rates, with the federal funds interest rate falling from 8.1% in 1990 to 3.5% in 1992. As the economy expanded, the unemployment rate declined from 7.5% in 1992 to less than 5% by 1997.\n\nEpisodes 5 and 6\n\nIn Episodes 5 and 6, the Federal Reserve perceived a risk of inflation and raised the federal funds rate from 3% to 5.8% from 1993 to 1995. Inflation did not rise, and the period of economic growth during the 1990s continued. Then in 1999 and 2000, the Fed was concerned that inflation seemed to be creeping up so it raised the federal funds interest rate from 4.6% in December 1998 to 6.5% in June 2000. By early 2001, inflation was declining again, but a recession occurred in 2001. Between 2000 and 2002, the unemployment rate rose from 4.0% to 5.8%.\n\nEpisodes 7 and 8\n\nIn Episodes 7 and 8, the Federal Reserve conducted a loose monetary policy and slashed the federal funds rate from 6.2% in 2000 to just 1.7% in 2002, and then again to 1% in 2003. They actually did this because of fear of Japan-style deflation. This persuaded them to lower the Fed funds further than they otherwise would have. The recession ended, but, unemployment rates were slow to decline in the early 2000s. Finally, in 2004, the unemployment rate declined and the Federal Reserve began to raise the federal funds rate until it reached 5% by 2007.\n\nEpisode 9\n\nIn Episode 9, as the Great Recession took hold in 2008, the Federal Reserve was quick to slash interest rates, taking them down to 2% in 2008 and to nearly 0% in 2009. When the Fed had taken interest rates down to near-zero by December 2008, the economy was still deep in recession. Open market operations could not make the interest rate turn negative. The Federal Reserve had to think “outside the box.”\n\nEpisode 10\n\nIn Episode 10, which started in March 2020, the Fed cut interest rates again, reducing the target federal funds rate from 2% to between 0–1/4% in a matter of weeks. Limited by the zero lower bound, the Fed once again had to think “outside the box” in order to further support the financial system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nAn expansionary (or loose) monetary policy raises the quantity of money and credit above what it otherwise would have been and reduces interest rates, boosting aggregate demand, and thus countering recession.\nA contractionary monetary policy, also called a tight monetary policy, reduces the quantity of money and credit below what it otherwise would have been and raises interest rates, seeking to hold down inflation.\nDuring the 2008–2009 recession, central banks around the world also used quantitative easing to expand the supply of credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does contractionary monetary policy cause interest rates to rise?\nWhy does expansionary monetary policy causes interest rates to drop?\nHow do the expansionary and contractionary monetary policy affect the quantity of money?\nHow do tight and loose monetary policy affect interest rates?\nHow do expansionary, tight, contractionary, and loose monetary policy affect aggregate demand?\nWhich kind of monetary policy would you expect in response to high inflation: expansionary or contractionary?

    "text": "16.3 Pitfalls for Monetary Policy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze whether monetary policy decisions should be made more democratically\nCalculate the velocity of money\nEvaluate the central bank’s influence on inflation, unemployment, asset bubbles, and leverage cycles\nCalculate the effects of monetary stimulus\n\n\n\nIn the real world, effective monetary policy faces a number of significant hurdles. Monetary policy affects the economy only after a time lag that is typically long and of variable length. Remember, monetary policy involves a chain of events: the central bank must perceive a situation in the economy, hold a meeting, and make a decision to react by tightening or loosening monetary policy. The change in monetary policy must percolate through the banking system, changing the quantity of loans and affecting interest rates. When interest rates change, businesses must change their investment levels and consumers must change their borrowing patterns when purchasing homes or cars. Then it takes time for these changes to filter through the rest of the economy.\nAs a result of this chain of events, monetary policy has little effect in the immediate future. Instead, its primary effects are felt perhaps one to three years in the future. The reality of long and variable time lags does not mean that a central bank should refuse to make decisions. It does mean that central banks should be humble about taking action, because of the risk that their actions can create as much or more economic instability as they resolve.\n\n16.3.1 Excess Reserves\nBanks are legally required to hold a minimum level of reserves, but no rule prohibits them from holding additional excess reserves above the legally mandated limit. For example, during a recession banks may be hesitant to lend, because they fear that when the economy is contracting, a high proportion of loan applicants become less likely to repay their loans.\nWhen many banks are choosing to hold excess reserves, expansionary monetary policy may not work well. This may occur because the banks are concerned about a deteriorating economy, while the central bank is trying to expand the money supply. If the banks prefer to hold excess reserves above the legally required level, the central bank cannot force individual banks to make loans. Similarly, sensible businesses and consumers may be reluctant to borrow substantial amounts of money in a recession, because they recognize that firms’ sales and employees’ jobs are more insecure in a recession, and they do not want to face the need to make interest payments. The result is that during an especially deep recession, an expansionary monetary policy may have little effect on either the price level or the real GDP.\nJapan experienced this situation in the 1990s and early 2000s. Japan’s economy entered a period of very slow growth, dipping in and out of recession, in the early 1990s. By February 1999, the Bank of Japan had lowered the equivalent of its federal funds rate to 0%. It kept it there most of the time through 2003. Moreover, in the two years from March 2001 to March 2003, the Bank of Japan also expanded the country's money supply by about 50%—an enormous increase. Even this highly expansionary monetary policy, however, had no substantial effect on stimulating aggregate demand. Japan’s economy continued to experience extremely slow growth into the mid-2000s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSHOULD MONETARY POLICY DECISIONS BE MADE MORE DEMOCRATICALLY?\nShould a nation’s Congress or legislature comprised of elected representatives conduct monetary policy or should a politically appointed central bank that is more independent of voters take charge? Here are some of the arguments.\n\nThe Case for Greater Democratic Control of Monetary Policy\n\nElected representatives pass taxes and spending bills to conduct fiscal policy by passing tax and spending bills. They could handle monetary policy in the same way. They will sometimes make mistakes, but in a democracy, it is better to have elected officials who are accountable to voters make mistakes instead of political appointees. After all, the people appointed to the top governing positions at the Federal Reserve—and to most central banks around the world—are typically bankers and economists. They are not representatives of borrowers like small businesses or farmers nor are they representatives of labor unions. Central banks might not be so quick to raise interest rates if they had to pay more attention to firms and people in the real economy.\n\nThe Case for an Independent Central Bank\n\nBecause the central bank has some insulation from day-to-day politics, its members can take a nonpartisan look at specific economic situations and make tough, immediate decisions when necessary. The idea of giving a legislature the ability to create money and hand out loans is likely to end up badly, sooner or later. It is simply too tempting for lawmakers to expand the money supply to fund their projects. The long term result will be rampant inflation. Also, a central bank, acting according to the laws passed by elected officials, can respond far more quickly than a legislature. For example, the U.S. budget takes months to debate, pass, and sign into law, but monetary policy decisions happen much more rapidly. Day-to-day democratic control of monetary policy is impractical and seems likely to lead to an overly expansionary monetary policy and higher inflation.\n\n\n\n\nThe problem of excess reserves does not affect contractionary policy. Central bankers have an old saying that monetary policy can be like pulling and pushing on a string: when the central bank pulls on the string and uses contractionary monetary policy, it can definitely raise interest rates and reduce aggregate demand.\nHowever, when the central bank tries to push on the string of expansionary monetary policy, the string may sometimes just fold up limp and have little effect, because banks decide not to loan out their excess reserves. Do not take this analogy too literally—expansionary monetary policy usually does have real effects, after that inconveniently long and variable lag. There are also times, like Japan’s economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when expansionary monetary policy has been insufficient to lift a recession-prone economy.\n\n\n16.3.2 Unpredictable Movements of Velocity\nVelocity is a term that economists use to describe how quickly money circulates through the economy. We define the velocity of money in a year as\n\\[\\text{Velocity} = \\frac{\\text{nominal GDP}}{\\text{money supply}}\\]\nSpecific measurements of velocity depend on the definition of the money supply used. Consider the velocity of M1, the total amount of currency in circulation and checking account balances. In 2009, for example, M1 was $1.7 trillion and nominal GDP was $14.3 trillion, so the velocity of M1 was 8.4 ($14.3 trillion/$1.7 trillion). A higher velocity of money means that the average dollar circulates more times in a year. A lower velocity means that the average dollar circulates fewer times in a year.\nSee the following Clear It Up feature for a discussion of how deflation could affect monetary policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENS DURING EPISODES OF DEFLATION?\nDeflation occurs when the rate of inflation is negative; that is, instead of money having less purchasing power over time, as occurs with inflation, money is worth more. Deflation can make it very difficult for monetary policy to address a recession.\nRemember that the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate minus the rate of inflation. If the nominal interest rate is 7% and the rate of inflation is 3%, then the borrower is effectively paying a 4% real interest rate. If the nominal interest rate is 7% and there is deflation of 2%, then the real interest rate is actually 9%. In this way, an unexpected deflation raises the real interest payments for borrowers. It can lead to a situation where borrowers do not repay an unexpectedly high number of loans, and banks find that their net worth is decreasing or negative. When banks are suffering losses, they become less able and eager to make new loans. Aggregate demand declines, which can lead to recession.\nThen the double-whammy: After causing a recession, deflation can make it difficult for monetary policy to work. Say that the central bank uses expansionary monetary policy to reduce the nominal interest rate all the way to zero—but the economy has 5% deflation. As a result, the real interest rate is 5%, and because a central bank cannot make the nominal interest rate negative, expansionary policy cannot reduce the real interest rate further.\nIn the U.S. economy during the early 1930s, deflation was 6.7% per year from 1930–1933, which caused many borrowers to default on their loans and many banks to end up bankrupt, which in turn contributed substantially to the Great Depression. Not all episodes of deflation, however, end in economic depression. Japan, for example, experienced deflation of slightly less than 1% per year from 1999–2002, which hurt the Japanese economy, but it still grew by about 0.9% per year over this period. There is at least one historical example of deflation coexisting with rapid growth. The U.S. economy experienced deflation of about 1.1% per year over the quarter-century from 1876–1900, but real GDP also expanded at a rapid clip of 4% per year over this time, despite some occasional severe recessions.\nThe central bank should be on guard against deflation and, if necessary, use expansionary monetary policy to prevent any long-lasting or extreme deflation from occurring. Except in severe cases like the Great Depression, deflation does not guarantee economic disaster.\n\n\nChanges in velocity can cause problems for monetary policy. To understand why, rewrite the definition of velocity so that the money supply is on the left-hand side of the equation. That is:\n\\[\\text{Money supply} \\times \\text{velocity} = \\text{Nominal GDP}\\]\nRecall from The Macroeconomic Perspective that\n\\[\\text{Nominal GDP} = \\text{Price Level (or GDP Deflator)} \\times \\text{Real GDP}.\\]\nTherefore\n\\[\\text{Money Supply} \\times  \\text{velocity} = \\text{Nominal GDP} = \\text{Price Level} \\times \\text{Real GDP}.\\]\nWe sometimes call this equation the basic quantity equation of money but, as you can see, it is just the definition of velocity written in a different form. This equation must hold true, by definition.\nIf velocity is constant over time, then a certain percentage rise in the money supply on the left-hand side of the basic quantity equation of money will inevitably lead to the same percentage rise in nominal GDP—although this change could happen through an increase in inflation, or an increase in real GDP, or some combination of the two. If velocity is changing over time but in a constant and predictable way, then changes in the money supply will continue to have a predictable effect on nominal GDP. If velocity changes unpredictably over time, however, then the effect of changes in the money supply on nominal GDP becomes unpredictable.\nFigure 16.8 illustrates the actual velocity of money in the U.S. economy as measured by using M1, the most common definition of the money supply. From 1960 up to about 1980, velocity appears fairly predictable; that is, it is increasing at a fairly constant rate. In the early 1980s, however, velocity as calculated with M1 becomes more variable.\nThe reasons for these sharp changes in velocity remain a puzzle. Economists suspect that the changes in velocity are related to innovations in banking and finance which have changed how we are using money in making economic transactions: for example, the growth of electronic payments; a rise in personal borrowing and credit card usage; and accounts that make it easier for people to hold money in savings accounts, where it is counted as M2, right up to the moment that they want to write a check on the money and transfer it to M1.\nSo far at least, it has proven difficult to draw clear links between these kinds of factors and the specific up-and-down fluctuations in M1. Given many changes in banking and the prevalence of electronic banking, economists now favor M2 as a measure of money rather than the narrower M1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.8: Velocity is the nominal GDP divided by the money supply for a given year. We can calculate different measures of velocity by using different measures of the money supply. Velocity, as calculated by using M1, has lacked a steady trend since the 1980s, instead bouncing up and down. (credit: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis)\n\n\n\nIn the 1970s, when velocity as measured by M1 seemed predictable, a number of economists, led by Nobel laureate Milton Friedman (1912–2006), argued that the best monetary policy was for the central bank to increase the money supply at a constant growth rate. These economists argued that with the long and variable lags of monetary policy, and the political pressures on central bankers, central bank monetary policies were as likely to have undesirable as to have desirable effects. Thus, these economists believed that the monetary policy should seek steady growth in the money supply of 3% per year. They argued that a steady monetary growth rate would be correct over longer time periods, since it would roughly match the growth of the real economy. In addition, they argued that giving the central bank less discretion to conduct monetary policy would prevent an overly activist central bank from becoming a source of economic instability and uncertainty. In this spirit, Friedman wrote in 1967: “The first and most important lesson that history teaches about what monetary policy can do—and it is a lesson of the most profound importance—is that monetary policy can prevent money itself from being a major source of economic disturbance.”\nAs the velocity of M1 began to fluctuate in the 1980s, having the money supply grow at a predetermined and unchanging rate seemed less desirable, because as the quantity theory of money shows, the combination of constant growth in the money supply and fluctuating velocity would cause nominal GDP to rise and fall in unpredictable ways. The jumpiness of velocity in the 1980s caused many central banks to focus less on the rate at which the quantity of money in the economy was increasing, and instead to set monetary policy by reacting to whether the economy was experiencing or in danger of higher inflation or unemployment.\n\n\n16.3.3 Unemployment and Inflation\nIf you were to survey central bankers around the world and ask them what they believe should be the primary task of monetary policy, the most popular answer by far would be fighting inflation. Most central bankers believe that the neoclassical model of economics accurately represents the economy over the medium to long term. Remember that in the neoclassical model of the economy, we draw the aggregate supply curve as a vertical line at the level of potential GDP, as Figure 16.9 shows.\nIn the neoclassical model, economists determine the level of potential GDP (and the natural rate of unemployment that exists when the economy is producing at potential GDP) by real economic factors. If the original level of aggregate demand is AD0, then an expansionary monetary policy that shifts aggregate demand to AD1 only creates an inflationary increase in the price level, but it does not alter GDP or unemployment. From this perspective, all that monetary policy can do is to lead to low inflation or high inflation—and low inflation provides a better climate for a healthy and growing economy.\nAfter all, low inflation means that businesses making investments can focus on real economic issues, not on figuring out ways to protect themselves from the costs and risks of inflation. In this way, a consistent pattern of low inflation can contribute to long-term growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.9: In a neoclassical view, monetary policy affects only the price level, not the level of output in the economy. For example, an expansionary monetary policy causes aggregate demand to shift from the original AD0 to AD1. However, the adjustment of the economy from the original equilibrium (E0) to the new equilibrium (E1) represents an inflationary increase in the price level from P0 to P1, but has no effect in the long run on output or the unemployment rate. In fact, no shift in AD will affect the equilibrium quantity of output in this model.\n\n\n\nThis vision of focusing monetary policy on a low rate of inflation is so attractive that many countries have rewritten their central banking laws since in the 1990s to have their bank practice inflation targeting, which means that the central bank is legally required to focus primarily on keeping inflation low. By 2014, central banks in 28 countries, including Austria, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, and the United Kingdom faced a legal requirement to target the inflation rate. A notable exception is the Federal Reserve in the United States, which does not practice inflation-targeting. Instead, the law governing the Federal Reserve requires it to take both unemployment and inflation into account.\nEconomists have no final consensus on whether a central bank should be required to focus only on inflation or should have greater discretion. For those who subscribe to the inflation targeting philosophy, the fear is that politicians who are worried about slow economic growth and unemployment will constantly pressure the central bank to conduct a loose monetary policy—even if the economy is already producing at potential GDP. In some countries, the central bank may lack the political power to resist such pressures, with the result of higher inflation, but no long-term reduction in unemployment. The U.S. Federal Reserve has a tradition of independence, but central banks in other countries may be under greater political pressure. For all of these reasons—long and variable lags, excess reserves, unstable velocity, and controversy over economic goals—monetary policy in the real world is often difficult. The basic message remains, however, that central banks can affect aggregate demand through the conduct of monetary policy and in that way influence macroeconomic outcomes.\n\n\n16.3.4 Asset Bubbles and Leverage Cycles\nOne long-standing concern about having the central bank focus on inflation and unemployment is that it may be overlooking certain other economic problems that are coming in the future. For example, from 1994 to 2000 during what was known as the “dot-com” boom, the U.S. stock market, which the Dow Jones Industrial Index measures (which includes 30 very large companies from across the U.S. economy), nearly tripled in value. The Nasdaq index, which includes many smaller technology companies, increased in value by a multiple of five from 1994 to 2000. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. Stock values as measured by the Dow Jones were almost 20% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. Stock values in the Nasdaq index were 50% lower in 2009 than they had been in 2000. The drop-off in stock market values contributed to the 2001 recession and the higher unemployment that followed.\nWe can tell a similar story about housing prices in the mid-2000s. During the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, housing prices increased at about 6% per year on average. During what came to be known as the “housing bubble” from 2003 to 2005, housing prices increased at almost double this annual rate. These rates of increase were clearly not sustainable. When housing prices fell in 2007 and 2008, many banks and households found that their assets were worth less than they expected, which contributed to the recession that started in 2007.\nAt a broader level, some economists worry about a leverage cycle, where “leverage” is a term financial economists use to mean “borrowing.” When economic times are good, banks and the financial sector are eager to lend, and people and firms are eager to borrow. Remember that a money multiplier determines the amount of money and credit in an economy —a process of loans made, money deposited, and more loans made. In good economic times, this surge of lending exaggerates the episode of economic growth. It can even be part of what lead prices of certain assets—like stock prices or housing prices—to rise at unsustainably high annual rates. At some point, when economic times turn bad, banks and the financial sector become much less willing to lend, and credit becomes expensive or unavailable to many potential borrowers. The sharp reduction in credit, perhaps combined with the deflating prices of a dot-com stock price bubble or a housing bubble, makes the economic downturn worse than it would otherwise be.\nThus, some economists have suggested that the central bank should not just look at economic growth, inflation, and unemployment rates, but should also keep an eye on asset prices and leverage cycles. Such proposals are quite controversial. If a central bank had announced in 1997 that stock prices were rising “too fast” or in 2004 that housing prices were rising “too fast,” and then taken action to hold down price increases, many people and their elected political representatives would have been outraged. Neither the Federal Reserve nor any other central banks want to take the responsibility of deciding when stock prices and housing prices are too high, too low, or just right. As further research explores how asset price bubbles and leverage cycles can affect an economy, central banks may need to think about whether they should conduct monetary policy in a way that would seek to moderate these effects.\nLet’s end this chapter with a Work it Out exercise in how the Fed—or any central bank—would stir up the economy by increasing the money supply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCALCULATING THE EFFECTS OF MONETARY STIMULUS\nSuppose that the central bank wants to stimulate the economy by increasing the money supply. The bankers estimate that the velocity of money is 3, and that the price level will increase from 100 to 110 due to the stimulus. Using the quantity equation of money, what will be the impact of an $800 billion dollar increase in the money supply on the quantity of goods and services in the economy given an initial money supply of $4 trillion?\n\nStep 1.\n\nWe begin by writing the quantity equation of money: MV = PQ. We know that initially V = 3, M = 4,000 (billion) and P = 100. Substituting these numbers in, we can solve for Q:\n\\[MV = PQ\\]\n\\[4,000 \\times 3 = 100 × Q\\]\n\\[Q = 120\\]\n\nStep 2.\n\nNow we want to find the effect of the addition $800 billion in the money supply, together with the increase in the price level. The new equation is:\n\\[MV = PQ\\]\n\\[4,800 \\times 3 = 110 × Q\\]\n\\[Q = 130.9\\]\n\nStep 3.\n\nIf we take the difference between the two quantities, we find that the monetary stimulus increased the quantity of goods and services in the economy by 10.9 billion.\n\n\n\n\nThe discussion in this chapter has focused on domestic monetary policy; that is, the view of monetary policy within an economy. Exchange Rates and International Capital Flows explores the international dimension of monetary policy, and how monetary policy becomes involved with exchange rates and international flows of financial capital.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTHE PROBLEM OF THE ZERO PERCENT INTEREST RATE LOWER BOUND\nIn 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve found itself in a difficult position. The federal funds rate was on its way to near zero, which meant that traditional open market operations, by which the Fed purchases U.S. Treasury Bills to lower short term interest rates, was no longer viable. This so called “zero bound problem,” prompted the Fed, under then Chair Ben Bernanke, to attempt some unconventional policies, collectively called quantitative easing.\nBy early 2014, quantitative easing nearly quintupled the amount of bank reserves. This likely contributed to the U.S. economy’s recovery, but the impact was muted, probably due to some of the hurdles mentioned in the last section of this module. The unprecedented increase in bank reserves also led to fears of inflation. As of early 2015, however, there have been no serious signs of a boom, with core inflation around a stable 1.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nMonetary policy is inevitably imprecise, for a number of reasons:\n\nthe effects occur only after long and variable lags;\nif banks decide to hold excess reserves, monetary policy cannot force them to lend; and\nvelocity may shift in unpredictable ways.\n\nThe basic quantity equation of money is MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is the price level, and Q is the real output of the economy.\nSome central banks, like the European Central Bank, practice inflation targeting, which means that the only goal of the central bank is to keep inflation within a low target range. Other central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, are free to focus on either reducing inflation or stimulating an economy that is in recession, whichever goal seems most important at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy might banks want to hold excess reserves in time of recession?\nWhy might the velocity of money change unexpectedly?\nWhich kind of monetary policy would you expect in response to recession: expansionary or contractionary?

However, in the long run, GDP is determined by the supply of labor, the stock of capital, and technological progress---in other words, the willingness of people to work and the overall resources the economy has to work with.",

If the demand for scooters rises at the same time that demand for tennis rackets falls, we would expect to see a rise in the price of scooters and a fall in the price of tennis rackets. Wages in the scooter industry would tend to increase, and wages in the tennis racket industry would tend to fall.\nSometimes, we see wages and prices in all industries rising of falling together. Why? Wages and prices will all tend to increase together during booms when GDP exceeds its full-employment level or potential output. Wages and prices will fall together during periods of recessions when GDP falls below full employment or potential output.\nif the economy is producing at a level above full employment, firms will find it increasingly difficult to hire and retain workers, and unemployment will be below its natural rate. Workers will find it easy to get and changes jobs. To attract workers and prevent them from leaving, firms will raise their wages. As one firm raises its wage, other firms will have to raise their wages even higher to attract the workers that remain. Wages are the largest cost of production for most firms.

    "text": "17.2 The Adjustment Process\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nAdjustment process\nAD and AS adjustments\n\n\n\nThe transition between the short run and the long run is easy to understand. If GDP is higher than potential output, the economy starts to overheat and wages and prices increases. This increase in wages and prices will then push the economy back to full employment. Using aggregate demand and aggregate supply, we can illustrate graphically how changing prices and wages help move the economy from the short to the long run. First, let's review the graphical representations of aggregate demand and aggregate supply:\n\nAggregate demand. Recall that the aggregate demand curve shows the relationship between the level of prices and the quantity of real GDP demanded.\nAggregate supply. Recall the there are two aggregate supply curves: - one for the short run and - one for the long run.\nThe short run aggregate supply curve is represented as a relatively flat curve. The shape of the curve reflects the idea that prices do not change very much in the short urn and that firms adjust production to meet demand.\nThe long run aggregate supply curve, however, is represented by a perfectly vertical line. The vertical line means that at any given price level, firms in the long run are producing all that they can, given the amount of labor, capital, and technology available to them in the economy. The line represents what firms can supply in the long run at a state of full employment or potential output.\n\n\n17.2.1 Returning to Full Employment from a Bust\nIn an earlier chapter, we looked at the adjustment process for an economy producing at a level of output exceeding full employment or potential output. Now let’s look at what happens if the economy is in a slump, producing below full employment or potential output. Panel A of Figure 17.1 shows an aggregate demand curve and the two aggregate supply curves.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.1: The adjustment process from a recession back to full employment. If the economy is operating below full employment, as shown in panel a, prices will fall, shifting down the short-run aggregate supply curve, as shown in panel B. This will return output to its full-employment level.\n\n\n\nIn the short run, output and prices are determined where the aggregate demand curve intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve—point \\(a\\). This point corresponds to the level of output \\(y_0\\) and a price level \\(P_0\\). Notice that \\(y_0\\) is a level less than full employment or potential output, \\(y_p\\).\nIn the long run, the level of prices and output is given by the intersection of the aggregate demand curve and the long-run aggregate supply curve—point \\(c\\). Output is at full employment, \\(y_p\\), and prices are at \\(P_F\\).\nHow does the economy move from point \\(a\\) in the short run to point \\(c\\) in the long run? Panel B of Figure 17.1 shows us how. At point \\(a\\), the current level of output, \\(y0\\), falls short of the full-employment level of output, \\(y_p\\). With output less than full employment, the unemployment rate is above the natural rate. Firms find it relatively easy to hire and retain workers, and wages and then prices begin to fall. As the level of prices decreases, the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts downward over time, as shown in Panel B.\nThis downward shift occurs because decreases in wages lower costs for firms. Competition between firms will lead to lower prices for their products. As shown in Panel B, this shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve will bring the economy to long-run equilibrium. The economy initially starts at point a, where output falls short of full employment. As prices fall from \\(P_0\\) to \\(P_1\\), the aggregate supply curve shifts downward from AS0 to AS1. The aggregate demand curve and the new aggregate supply curve intersect at point \\(b\\).\nThis point corresponds to a lower level of prices and a higher level of real output. However, the higher level of output still is less than full employment. Wages and prices will continue to fall, shifting the short-run aggregate supply curve downward. Eventually, the aggregate supply curve will shift to \\(AS_2\\), and the economy will reach point \\(c\\), the intersection of the aggregate demand curve and the long-run aggregate supply curve. At this point, the adjustment stops because the economy is at full employment and the unemployment rate is at the natural rate. With unemployment at the natural rate, the downward wage–price spiral ends. The economy has made the transition to the long run. Prices are lower and output returns to full employment. This is how an economy recovers from a recession or a downturn\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nHow the Economy Recovers from a Downturn?\n– If the economy is operating below full employment, as shown in Panel A, prices will fall, shifting down the short-run aggregate supply curve, as shown in Panel B.\n– This will return output to its full-employment level\n\n\n\n\n17.2.2 Returning to Full Employment from a Boom\nBut what if the economy is “too hot” instead of sluggish? What will then happen is the process we just described, only in reverse, as we show in Figure 17.2. When output exceeds potential, unemployment will be below the natural rate. As firms bid for labor, the wage–price spiral will begin, but this time in an upward direction instead of downward as in Panel B. The short-run aggregate supply curve will shift upward until the economy returns to full employment. That is, wages and prices will rise to return the economy to its long-run equilibrium at full employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.2: Returning to Full Employment from a Boom. If the economy is operating above full employment, as shown in panel a, prices will rise, shifting the short-run aggregate supply curve upward, as shown in panel B. This will return output to its fullemployment level.\n\n\n\nIf the economy is operating above full employment, \\(Y_{0}&gt;Y_{F}\\), as shown in Figure 17.2 Panel A, prices will rise, shifting the short-run aggregate supply curve upward, as shown in Panel B. This will return output to its full-employment level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn summary:\n\n– If output is less than full employment, prices will fall as the economy\n\nreturns to full employment as shown in Figure 17.1.\n\n\n– If output exceeds full employment then\n– Economy is overheating – Wages and prices rise – Higher price increases the demand for money – Interests rise and decrease investment – Which reduces the level of output back to full employment levels as shown in Figure 17.2\n\n\n\n\n17.2.3 Details on the Adjustment Process\nEarlier in the chapter we explained that changes in wages and prices restore the economy to full employment in the long run, and that the government and the Fed can get it there more quickly with fiscal and monetary policy. But what is happening behind the scenes? What do changes in wages and the price level mean for the economy in terms of money demand, interest rates, and investment spending? Let’s go back and take a closer look at the adjustment process in terms of these factors so we can better understand how the adjustment process actually works.\nFirst, recall that when an economy is producing below full employment, the tendency will be for wages and prices to fall. Similarly, when an economy is producing at a level exceeding full employment or potential output, the tendency will be for wages and prices to rise.\nThe adjustment process first begins to work as changes in prices affect the demand for money. Recall the real-nominal principle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nReal-Nominal Principle\nWhat matters to people is the real value of money or income—its purchasing power—not the face value of money or income.\n\n\nAccording to this principle, the amount of money people want to hold depends on the price level in the economy. If prices are cut in half, you need to hold only half as much money to purchase the same goods and services. Decreases in the price level will cause the money demand curve to shift to the left; increases in the price level will shift it to the right. Now let’s put this idea to use.\nSuppose the economy is initially in a recession. With output below full employment, actual unemployment will exceed the natural rate of unemployment, so there will be excess unemployment. Wages and prices will start to fall. Figure 17.3 shows how the fall in the price level can restore the economy to full employment via money demand, interest rates, and investment without active fiscal or monetary policy. First, we show with the AD–AS diagram in Panel A of Figure 17.3 how prices fall when the economy is operating below full employment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.3: Details on the adjustment process. With the economy initially below full employment, the price level falls, as shown in panel a, stimulating output. in panel B, the lower price level decreases the demand for money and leads to lower interest rates at point d. in panel C, lower interest rates lead to higher investment spending at point f. as the economy moves down the aggregate demand curve from point a toward full employment at point b in panel a, investment spending increases along the aggregate demand curve.\n\n\n\nSecond, in Panel B of Figure 17.3, the fall in the price level decreases the demand for holding money. As the price level decreases from \\(P_0\\) to \\(P_1\\), the demand for money shifts to the left from \\(M^d_0\\) to \\(M^d_1\\). Interest rates fall from \\(r_0\\) to \\(r_1\\), and the falling interest rates increase investment spending from \\(I_0\\) to \\(I_1\\). As the level of investment spending in the economy increases, total demand for goods and services also increases, and the economy moves down along the aggregate demand curve as it returns to full employment. Now you can also understand why the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping through the interest rate effect. As we move down the aggregate demand curve, lower prices lead to lower interest rates, higher investment spending, and a higher level of aggregate demand. Thus, aggregate demand increases as the price level falls, which explains why the curve slopes downward.\nWhat we have just described continues until the economy reaches full employment. As long as actual output is below the economy’s full-employment level, prices will continue to fall. A fall in the price level reduces money demand and interest rates. Lower interest rates stimulate investment spending and push the economy back toward full employment. All this works in reverse if output exceeds the economy’s potential output. In this case, the economy is overheating and wages and prices rise. A higher price level will increase the demand for money and raise interest rates. Higher interest rates will decrease investment spending and reduce the level of output. The process continues until the economy “cools off” and returns to full employment.\nNow you should understand why changes in wages and prices restore the economy to full employment. The key is that (1) changes in wages and prices change the demand for money, and (2) this changes interest rates, which then affect aggregate demand for goods and services and ultimately GDP.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLiquidity Trap\nWe can also use the model we just developed to understand the liquidity trap and the economics of the zero lower bound. If an economy is in a recession, interest rates will fall, restoring the economy to full employment. But at some point, interest rates may become so low they equal zero. Nominal interest rates cannot go far below zero because investors would rather hold money (which pays a zero rate) than hold a bond that promises a negative return.\nSuppose, however, that as interest rates approach zero, the economy is still in a slump. The adjustment process then has nowhere to go. This appears to be what happened in Japan in the 1990s. Interest rates on government bonds were zero, but prices continued to fall. At this point, the fall in prices by itself could not restore the economy to full employment.\nPolicymakers in the United States also became concerned by this possibility. When interest rates on 3-month U.S. government bills fell below 1 percent from June 2003 to May 2004, Fed officials openly discussed their limited options if further monetary stimulus became necessary. What can policymakers do if an economy is in a recession but nominal rates become so close to zero that the natural adjustment process ceases to work? Economists have suggested several solutions to this problem.\n\nFirst, expansionary fiscal policy— cutting taxes or raising government spending—still remains a viable option to increase aggregate demand.\nSecond, the Fed could become extremely aggressive and try to expand the money supply so rapidly that the public begins to anticipate future inflation. If the public expects inflation, the expected real rate of interest (the nominal rate minus the expected inflation rate) can become negative, even if the nominal rate cannot fall below zero. A negative expected real interest rate will tempt firms to invest, and this will increase aggregate demand.\n\n\n\nIn summary, the adjustment process works as follows:\n\nWith the economy initially below full employment, the price level falls, as shown in Panel A, stimulating output\nIn Panel B, the lower price level decreases the demand for money and leads to lower interest rates at point d\nIn Panel C, lower interest rates lead to higher investment spending at point f\nAs the economy moves down the AD curve from point a toward full employment at point b in Panel A, investment spending increases along the AD curve\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Connection with the Expenditure Model\nIn Figure 17.4 and Figure 17.5 we also include the expenditure model graph so you can see how the mechanism works.

    "text": "17.3 How Economic Policy Can Hasten the Speed of Adjustment\nHow long does it take to move from the short run to the long run? Economists disagree on the answer. Some economists estimate it takes the U.S. economy 2 years or less, some say 6 years, and others say somewhere in between. Because the adjustment process is slow, there is room, in principle, for policymakers to step in and guide the economy back to full employment.\nSuppose the economy is operating below full employment at point \\(a\\) in Figure 17.6. One alternative for policymakers is to do nothing, allowing the economy to adjust itself with falling wages and prices until it returns by itself to full employment, point \\(b\\). This may take several years. During that time, the economy will experience excess unemployment and a level of real output below potential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.6: Fiscal policy can stimulate aggregate demand. Rather than letting the economy naturally return to full employment at point b, economic policies could be implemented to increase aggregate demand from \\(AD_0\\) to \\(AD_1\\) to bring the economy to full employment at point c. the price level within the economy, however, would be higher.\n\n\n\nAnother alternative is to use expansionary policies, such as open market purchases (of bonds) by the Fed or increases in government spending and tax cuts, to shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIORB rate is the new monetary policy tool since 2020!\nKeep in mind that since 2020 the Fed pays interest on bank reserves and uses that Interest on Bank Reserves (IORB) rate as the new monetary policy tool. Expansionary monetary policy would mean that the Fed lowers the IORB rate. This reduces the amount of reserves held with the central bank and private banks have more funds to give out loans, which expands money supply.\n\n\nIn Figure 17.6, we show how expansionary policies could shift the aggregate demand curve from \\(AD_0\\) to \\(AD_1\\) and move the economy to full employment, point \\(c\\). Notice here that the price level is higher at point \\(c\\) than it would be at point \\(b\\).\nDemand policies can also prevent a wage–price spiral from emerging if the economy is producing at a level of output above full employment. Rather than letting an increase in wages and prices bring the economy back to full employment, we can reduce aggregate demand.\nEither contractionary monetary policy—open-market sales—or contractionary fiscal policy—cuts in government spending or tax increases—can be used to reduce aggregate demand and the level of GDP until it reaches potential output.\nExpansionary policies and demand policies are stabilization policies, which look simple on paper or on graphs. In practice, the lags and uncertainties we discussed for both fiscal and monetary policy make economic stabilization difficult to achieve.\nFor example, suppose we are in a recession and the Fed decides to increase aggregate demand using expansionary monetary policy. There will be a lag in the time it takes for the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right. In the meantime, the adjustment that occurs during a recession—falling wages and prices—has begun to shift the short-run aggregate supply curve downward.\nIt is conceivable that if the adjustment were fast enough, the economy would be restored to full employment before the effects of the expansionary monetary policy were actually felt. When the expansionary monetary policy kicks in and the aggregate demand curve finally shifts to the right, the additional aggregate demand would increase the level of output so it exceeded the full-employment level, leading to a wage–price spiral.\nIn this case, monetary policy would have destabilized the economy. Active economic policies are more likely to destabilize the economy if the adjustment is quick enough. Economists like Milton Friedman (1912–2006) of the University of Chicago believed the economy adjusts rapidly to full employment and generally opposed using monetary or fiscal policy to try to stabilize the economy. Economists like John Maynard Keynes believed that the economy adjusted slowly and were more sympathetic to using monetary or fiscal policy to stabilize the economy. It is possible that the speed of adjustment can vary over time, making decisions about policy even more difficult.\nAs an example, economic advisers for President George H. W. Bush had to decide whether the economy needed any additional stimulus after the recession of 1990. Based on the view that the economy would recover quickly on its own, they took only some minor steps. The economy did largely recover by the very end of the Bush administration, but too late for his reelection prospects.\n\n17.3.1 Liquidity Traps\nUp to this point, we have assumed the economy could always recover from a recession without active policy, although it may take a long time. Economist John Maynard Keynes expressed doubts about whether a country could recover from a major recession without active policy. He had two distinct reasons for these doubts.\n\nFirst, as we discuss later in the chapter, the adjustment process requires interest rates to fall and thereby increase investment spending. But suppose nominal interest rates become so low that they could not fall any further. Keynes called this situation a liquidity trap. Today, this is known as the zero lower bound for interest rates—that is, they cannot fall below zero. When the economy is experiencing a liquidity trap or the zero lower bound, the adjustment process no longer works.\nSecond, Keynes feared falling prices could hurt businesses (i.e., more difficult to repay debt). Japan seems to have suffered from both these problems in the 1990s and the United States faced similar issues during the first decade of this century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolutions if in Liquidity Trap?\n\n\n\n\nExpansionary fiscal policy could still work\nFed could become very aggressive and expand money supply rapidly to generate expected inflation rightarrowcould turn real interest rate negative rightarrow stimulate investment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nRecall that the aggregate demand curve represents the total demand for all currently produced goods and services at different price levels\nThe short-run aggregate supply curve is represented as a relatively flat curve that reflects the idea that prices do not change very much in the short run and that firms adjust production to meet demand\nThe long-run aggregate supply curve is represented by a perfectly vertical line at the full-employment level of output\nRather than letting the economy naturally return to full employment, economic policies could be implemented to increase aggregate demand to bring the economy to full employment faster.

    "text": "17.4 The Long-Run Neutrality of Money\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nMoney neutrality in the long-run\n\n\n\nAn increase in the money supply has a different effect on the economy in the short run than it does in the long run. In Figure 17.7, we show the effects of expansionary monetary policy in both the short run and the long run. In the short run, as the supply of money increases, the economy moves from the original equilibrium to point a, with output above potential. But in the long run, the economy returns to point \\(b\\) at full employment, but at a higher price level than at the original equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.7: Money neutrality in the long-run. As the Fed increases the supply of money, the aggregate demand curve shifts from \\(AD_0\\) to \\(AD_1\\) and the economy moves to point \\(a\\). In the long run, the economy moves to point \\(b\\).\n\n\n\nHow can the Federal Reserve change the level of output in the short run but affect prices only in the long run? Why is the short run different from the long run? We can use our model of the demand for money and investment to understand this issue.\nAssume the economy starts at full employment. In Figure 17.8, interest rates are at \\(r_F\\), and investment spending is at \\(I_F\\). Now, suppose the Federal Reserve increases the money supply from \\(M^s_0\\) to \\(M^s_1\\). We show this as a rightward movement in the money-supply curve. In the short run, the increase in the supply of money will reduce interest rates to \\(r_0\\), and the level of investment spending will increase to \\(I_0\\). Increased investment will stimulate the economy and increase output above full employment. All this occurs in the short run. The red arrows show the movements in interest rates and investment in the short run. However, once output exceeds full employment, wages and prices will start to increase. As the price level increases, the demand for money will increase. This will shift the money-demand curve upward and will start to increase interest rates. Investment will start to fall as interest rates increase, leading to a fall in output. The blue arrows in Figure 17.8 show the transition as prices increase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.8: Money neutrality in the long-run. Starting at full employment, an increase in the supply of money from \\(M^s_0\\) to \\(M^s_1\\) will initially reduce interest rates from \\(r_F\\) to \\(r_0\\) (from point \\(a\\) to point \\(b\\)) and raise investment spending from \\(I_F\\) to \\(I_0\\) (point \\(c\\) to point \\(d\\)). We show these changes with the red arrows. the blue arrows show that as the price level increases, the demand for money increases, restoring interest rates and investment to their prior levels—\\(r_F\\) and \\(I_F\\), respectively. Both money supplied and money demanded will remain at a higher level, though, at point \\(e\\).\n\n\n\nAs long as output exceeds full employment, prices will continue to rise, money demand will continue to increase, and interest rates will continue to rise. Where does this process end? It ends only when interest rates return to their original level of \\(r_F\\).\nAt an interest rate of \\(r_F\\), investment spending will have returned to \\(I_F\\). This is the level of investment that meets the total level of demand for goods and services and keeps the economy at full employment. When the economy returns to full employment, the levels of real interest rates, investment, and output are precisely the same as they were before the Fed increased the supply of money. The increase in the supply of money had no effect on real interest rates, investment, or output in the long run. Economists call this the long-run neutrality of money. In other words, in the long run, changes in the supply of money are neutral with respect to real variables in the economy. For example, if the price of everything in the economy doubles, including your paycheck, you are no better or worse off than you were before. In the long run, increases in the supply of money have no effect on real variables, only on prices.\nThis example points out how, in the long run, it really does not matter how much money is in circulation because prices will adjust to the amount of nominal money available. In the short run, however, money is not neutral. In the short run, changes in the supply of money do affect interest rates, investment spending, and output. The Fed does have strong powers over real GDP, but those powers are ultimately temporary. In the long run, all the Fed can do is determine the level of prices in the economy.\nNow we can understand why the job of the Federal Reserve has been described by William McChesney Martin, Jr., a former Federal Reserve chairman, as “taking the punch bowl away at the party.” The punch bowl is money: If the Fed sets out the punch bowl, this will temporarily increase output or give the economy a brief high. But if the Federal Reserve is worried about increases in prices in the long run, it must take the punch bowl away and everyone must sober up. If not, the result will be continuing increases in prices, or inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIncluding the Consumption-Expenditure Graph to the Model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.9: Money neutrality in the long-run adding the expenditure model graph. This graph shows the connection between the increase in investment and the subsequent increase in aggregate demand.\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's summarize the adjustment processes:\n\nFed increases \\(M^{s}, M^{d}\\) adjusts, prices rise and GDP stays constant\nAs the Fed increases the supply of money, the aggregate demand curve shifts from \\(AD_{0}\\) to \\(AD_{1}\\)\nIn the long run, the economy returns to long-run equilibrium\n\nIn more detail:\n\nStarting at full employment, an increase in the supply of money from \\(M_{0}^{s}\\) to \\(M_{1}^{s}\\) will initially\n\nreduce interest rates from \\(r_{F}\\) to \\(r_{0} \\rightarrow\\) point a to point b and\nraise investment spending from \\(I_{_{F}}\\) to \\(I_{0} \\rightarrow\\) point c to point d\n\nWe show these changes with the red arrows in Figure 17.8.\nThe blue arrows in Figure 17.8 show that as the price level increases, the demand for money increases, restoring interest rates and investment to their prior levels—\\(r_{F}\\) and \\(I_{F}\\), respectively\nBoth money supplied and money demanded will remain at a higher level, though, at point e in Figure 17.8.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nMoney is NOT Neutral in the Short Run.\nIn the short run, monetary policy is not neutral.

Adam Smith was the first so-called classical economist. Other classical economists—Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Thomas Malthus—developed their work during the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Keynes first used the term classical model in the 1930s to contrast it with his Keynesian model, which emphasized the difficulties the economy could face in the short run. The ideas developed in this chapter can shed some light on a historical debate in economics about the role of full employment in modern Keynesian and classical thought.\n\nThe term “classical model” was first used by Keynes to contrast his “Keynesian” or activist model with the conventional economic wisdom of the time that didn’t emphasize the difficulties that the economy could face in the short run\n\nClassical economics is often associated with Say’s law, the doctrine that “supply creates its own demand.” To understand Say’s law, recall from our discussion of GDP accounting in Chapter 5 that production in an economy creates an equivalent amount of income. For example, if GDP is $10 trillion, then production is $10 trillion, and $10 trillion in income is generated. The classical economists argued that the $10 trillion of production also created $10 trillion in demand for current goods and services. This meant there could never be a shortage of demand for total goods and services in the economy, nor any excess.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSay’s Law\n\n\n\n“supply creates its own demand.”\n\n\nBut suppose consumers, who earned the income, decided to save rather than spend it. Wouldn’t this increase in saving lead to a shortfall in the total demand for goods and services? Wouldn’t, say, inventories of goods pile up in warehouses? Classical economists argued no, that the increase in savings would eventually find its way to an equivalent increase in investment spending by firms because the savings by households would eventually get channeled to firms via financial markets. As a result, spending on consumption and investment together would be sufficient so that all the goods and services produced in the economy would be purchased.\nKeynes, on the other hand, argued that there could be situations in which total demand fell short of total production in the economy for extended periods of time. In particular, if consumers increased their savings, there was no guarantee that investment spending would rise to offset the decrease in consumption. And if total spending did fall short of total demand, goods and services would go unsold. When producers could not sell their goods, they would cut back on production, and output in the economy would consequently fall, leading to a recession or depression.\nIn summary:\n\nSince production creates an equivalent amount of income, there could never be a shortage of demand for total goods and services in the economy nor any excess\nIf consumers saved, those savings would eventually turn into investment spending\nKeynes argued that there could be situations in which total demand fell short of total production in the economy, leading to a recession or depression\n– If wages and prices are not fully flexible, then Keynes’s view that demand could fall short of production is more likely to hold true\n– However, over longer periods of time, wages and prices do adjust and the insights of the classical model are restored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nKeynesian and Classical Debates\nThe debates between Keynesian and classical economists continued for several decades after Keynes developed his theories. In the 1940s, Professor Don Patinkin and Nobel Laureate Franco Modigliani clarified the conditions for which the classical model would hold true. In particular, they studied the conditions under which there would be sufficient demand for goods and services when the economy was at full employment. Both economists emphasized that one of the necessary conditions for the classical model to work was that wages and prices must be fully flexible—that is, they must adjust rapidly to changes in demand and supply.\nIf wages and prices are not fully flexible, then Keynes’s view that demand could fall short of production is more likely to hold true. We’ve seen that over short periods of time, wages and prices, indeed, are not fully flexible, so Keynes’s insights are important. However, over longer periods of time, wages and prices do adjust and the insights of the classical model are restored.\nTo help clarify the conditions under which the economy will return to full employment in the long run on its own, Patinkin and Modigliani developed the adjustmentprocess model we used in this chapter. They highlighted many of the key points we emphasized, including the speed of the adjustment process and possible pitfalls, such as liquidity traps.\n\n\n\n\n17.5.2 Speed of Adjustment and Keynes' Ideas\nHow long does it take to move from the short run to the long run? Economists disagree on the answer. Some economists estimate it takes the U.S. economy 2 years or less, some say 6 years, and others say somewhere in between. Because the adjustment process is slow, there is room, in principle, for policymakers to step in and guide the economy back to full employment.\nSuppose the economy is operating below full employment at point a in Figure 17.11. One alternative for policymakers is to do nothing, allowing the economy to adjust itself with falling wages and prices until it returns by itself to full employment, point b. This may take several years. During that time, the economy will experience excess unemployment and a level of real output below potential. Another alternative is to use expansionary policies, such as open market purchases by the Fed or increases in government spending and tax cuts, to shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.11: Stimulating the economy a la Keynes. Rather than letting the economy naturally return to full employment at point b, economic policies could be implemented to increase aggregate demand from \\(AD_0\\) to \\(AD_1\\) to bring the economy to full employment at point \\(c\\). The price level within the economy, however, would be higher.\n\n\n\nIn Figure 17.11, we show how expansionary policies could shift the aggregate demand curve from \\(AD_0\\) to \\(AD_1\\) and move the economy to full employment, point \\(c\\). Notice here that the price level is higher at point \\(c\\) than it would be at point \\(b\\).\nDemand policies can also prevent a wage–price spiral from emerging if the economy is producing at a level of output above full employment. Rather than letting an increase in wages and prices bring the economy back to full employment, we can reduce aggregate demand. Either\n\ncontractionary monetary policy—open-market sales—or\ncontractionary fiscal policy—cuts in government spending or tax increases\n\ncan be used to reduce aggregate demand and the level of GDP until it reaches potential output.\nExpansionary policies and demand policies are stabilization policies, which look simple on paper or on graphs. In practice, the lags and uncertainties we discussed for both fiscal and monetary policy make economic stabilization difficult to achieve. For example, suppose we are in a recession and the Fed decides to increase aggregate demand using expansionary monetary policy. There will be a lag in the time it takes for the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right. In the meantime, the adjustment that occurs during a recession—falling wages and prices—has begun to shift the short-run aggregate supply curve downward.\nIt is conceivable that if the adjustment were fast enough, the economy would be restored to full employment before the effects of the expansionary monetary policy were actually felt. When the expansionary monetary policy kicks in and the aggregate demand curve finally shifts to the right, the additional aggregate demand would increase the level of output so it exceeded the full-employment level, leading to a wage–price spiral. In this case, monetary policy would have destabilized the economy.\nActive economic policies are more likely to destabilize the economy if the adjustment is quick enough. Economists like Milton Friedman (1912–2006) of the University of Chicago believed the economy adjusts rapidly to full employment and generally opposed using monetary or fiscal policy to try to stabilize the economy. Economists like John Maynard Keynes believed that the economy adjusted slowly and were more sympathetic to using monetary or fiscal policy to stabilize the economy.\nIt is possible that the speed of adjustment can vary over time, making decisions about policy even more difficult. As an example, economic advisers for President George H. W. Bush had to decide whether the economy needed any additional stimulus after the recession of 1990. Based on the view that the economy would recover quickly on its own, they took only some minor steps. The economy did largely recover by the very end of the Bush administration, but too late for his reelection prospects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nHow long does it take to move from the short run to the long run?\nEstimates range from 2 to 6 years!\nKeynes or Not Keynes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.12: Short run and long run considerations?\n\n\n\n\nWe are at A\nDo nothing and wait till D\nOr do Keynesian expansionary policy and get to E\n\n\nIs it a Question of Believe?\n\nSome economists think that the economy adjusts quickly to the full employment level and that fiscal or monetary policy destabilize the economy (classical approach)\nSo the long run is actually quite short\nOthers believe that the economy is slow to adjust and hence monetary or fiscal policy make sense (Keynesian view)\nIn the long run we are all dead (according to Keynes)\nThat’s how long the long run is!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would a classical economist prescribe during a recession?\nWhat would a Keynesian economist prescribe during a boom?",

    "text": "17.6 Political Economy Considerations\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter Learning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nCrowding out\nTax Cuts\nPolitical Business Cycles\n\n\n\nSome economists are strong proponents of increasing government spending on defense or other programs to stimulate the economy. Critics, however, say increases in spending provide only temporary relief and ultimately harm the economy because government spending crowds out investment spending. In an earlier chapter, we discussed the idea of crowding out. We can now understand the idea in more detail. Suppose the economy starts out at full employment and then the government increases its spending. This will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, causing output to increase beyond full employment. As we have seen, the result of this boom will be that wages and prices increase.\n\n17.6.1 Crowding Out\nNow let’s turn to our model of money demand and investment. Figure 17.13 shows that as prices increase, the demand for money shifts upward in Panel A, raising interest rates from \\(r_0\\) to \\(r_1\\) and reducing investment from \\(I_0\\) to \\(I_1\\), as shown in Panel B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17.13: Government stimulus (spending) is crowding out private investment. Starting at full employment, an increase in government spending raises output above full employment. As wages and prices increase, the demand for money increases, as shown in panel a, raising interest rates from \\(r_0\\) to \\(r_1\\) (point \\(a\\) to point \\(b\\)) and reducing investment from \\(I_0\\) to \\(I_1\\) (point \\(c\\) to point \\(d\\)). The economy returns to full employment, but at a higher level of interest rates and a lower level of investment spending.\n\n\n\nHigher interest rates are the mechanism through which crowding out of public investment occurs. As investment spending by the public then falls (gets crowded out), we know that aggregate demand decreases. This process will continue until the economy returns to full employment. Once the economy returns to full employment, the decrease in investment spending by the public will exactly match the increase in government spending.\nHowever, when the economy does return to full employment, it will be at a higher interest rate level and lower level of investment spending by the public. Thus, the increase in government spending has no long-run effect on the level of output—just on the interest rate. Instead, the increase in government spending displaced, or crowded out, private investment spending. If the government spending went toward government investment projects—such as bridges or roads—then it will have just replaced an equivalent amount of private investment. If the increased government spending did not go toward providing investment but, for example, went for military spending, then the reduction in private investment will have reduced total investment in the economy, private and public. This decrease in total investment would have further negative effects on the economy over time. As we saw in earlier chapters, a reduction in investment spending reduces capital deepening and leads to lower levels of real income and wages in the future.\nEconomists make similar arguments when it comes to tax cuts. Tax cuts initially will increase consumer spending and lead to a higher level of GDP. In the long run, however, adjustments in wages and prices restore the economy to full employment. However, interest rates will rise during the adjustment process and this increase in interest rates will crowd out private investment. In the long run, the increase in consumption spending will come at the expense of lower investment spending, decreased capital deepening, and lower levels of real income and wages in the future. Crowding out can occur from sources other than the government. Expected increases in U.S. health-care expenditures will pose similar challenges to crowding out in the coming decades as well.\nWhat about decreases in government spending or increases in taxes? Decreases in government spending, such as cuts in military spending, will lead to increases in investment in the long run, which we call crowding in. Initially, a decrease in government spending will cause a decrease in real GDP. But as prices fall, the demand for money will decrease, and interest rates will fall. Lower interest rates will crowd in investment as the economy returns to full employment. In the longer run, the higher investment spending will raise living standards through capital deepening. Increased taxes, to the extent they reduce consumption spending, will crowd in investment through precisely the same mechanism.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nCrowding Out Summary\n\nKeynes claims that increases in G, stimulates the economy\nCritics say, that this works only temporarily and ultimately harms the economy because G will crowd out investment spending\nStarting at full employment, an increase in government spending G raises output above full employment\nAs wages and prices increase,\n\nthe demand for money increases, as shown in Panel A of Figure 17.13\nraising interest rates from \\(r_0\\) to \\(r_1 \\rightarrow\\) point \\(a\\) to point \\(b\\) and\nreducing investment from \\(I_0\\) to \\(I_1 \\rightarrow\\) point \\(c\\) to point \\(d\\)\n\nHence an increase of \\(G\\) decreased \\(I\\) and \\(Y\\) stayed constant in the long run\nThe economy returns to full employment, but at a higher level of interest rates and a lower level of investment spending\nIn the previous illustration, a long run increase in government spending has no long-run effect on the level of output—just the interest rate\nInstead, the increase in government spending displaced, or crowded out, private investment spending\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nExample\n\nIn 1950, health-care expenditures in the United States were 5.2 percent of GDP; by 2000, this share had risen to 15.4 percent\nSince 1950, the average life span has increased by 1.7 years per decade\nTwo economists, Charles I. Jones and Robert E. Hall, go further and suggest normal increases in economic growth will propel health-care expenditures to approximately 30 percent of GDP by mid-century\nTheir argument is that as societies grow wealthier, individuals face the trade-off of buying more goods (automobiles or cars) to enjoy their current life span or spending more on healthcare to extend their lives\nAssuming this argument is correct and health-care expenditures increase, what other component of GDP will fall?\n\nIf investment is crowded out, living standards would fall in the long-run, reducing the ability to consume both health and non-health goods\nSpending on health would then come at the expense of spending on consumer durables or larger houses. That would be the preferred outcome\n\n\n\n\n\n\n17.6.2 Tax Cuts\nTax cuts may initially increase consumer spending and lead to a higher levels of GDP (expansionary fiscal policy). However, in the long run adjustments in wages and prices restore the economy to full employment output.\n\n\nInterest rates will rise during the adjustment process and crowd out investment\nWages and prices will fall again\n\n\nCrowding In\n\nCuts in G (like cuts in military spending) will lead to increases in investment in the long run\nInitially though a decrease in G will cause a decrease in real GDP\nAs prices fall interest go down \\(\\rightarrow\\) and I goes up\n\n\n\n17.6.3 Political Business Cycles\nUp to now, we have assumed policymakers are motivated to use policy to try to improve the economy. But suppose they are more interested in promoting their personal wellbeing and the fortunes of their political parties? Using monetary or fiscal policy in the short run to improve a politician’s reelection prospects may generate what is known as a political business cycle.\nHere is how a political business cycle might work. About a year or so before an election, a politician might use expansionary monetary policy or fiscal policy to stimulate the economy and lower unemployment. If voters respond favorably to lower unemployment, the incumbent politician may be reelected. After reelection, the politician faces the prospect of higher prices or crowding out. To avoid this, the politician may engage in contractionary policies. The result is a classic political business cycle: Because of actions taken by politicians for reelection, the economy booms before an election but contracts afterward. Good news comes before the election, and bad news comes later. It is clear the classic political business cycle does not always occur; however, a number of episodes fit the scenario. President Richard Nixon used expansionary policies during a reelection campaign in 1972, which resulted in inflation. However, counterexamples also exist, such as President Jimmy Carter’s deliberate attempt to reduce inflation with contractionary policies just before his reelection bid in the late 1970s.\nAlthough the evidence on the classic political business cycle is mixed, there may be links between elections and economic outcomes. More recent research has investigated the systematic differences that may exist between political parties and economic outcomes. All this research takes into account both the short- and long-run effects of economic policies.\nIn Summary:\n\nUsing monetary and fiscal policy in the short run to improve a politician’s reelection prospects may generate what is known as a political business cycle\n\nIn a classic political business cycle, the economy booms before an election but then contracts after the election\nThe original political business cycle theories focused on incumbent presidents trying to manipulate the economy in their favor to gain reelection\n\nSubsequent research began to incorporate other, more realistic factors:\n\nThe first innovation was to recognize that political parties could have different goals or preferences\nRepublicans historically have been more concerned about fighting inflation, whereas Democrats have placed more weight on reducing unemployment\n\nThe second major innovation was to recognize that the public would anticipate that politicians will try to manipulate the economy\n\nIf the public is not sure who will win the election, the outcome will be a surprise to them—a contractionary surprise if Republicans win and an expansionary surprise if Democrats win\nThis suggests that economic growth should be less if Republicans win and greater if Democrats win\nThe postwar U.S. evidence is generally supportive of this theory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Concepts and Summary\n\n\n\n\nCrowding out refers to a situation where government spending (or consumption) leads to a reduction in personal consumption, investments and savings because the government is sucking up the available resources.\nIncreases in government spending will raise real interest rates and crowd out investment in the long run. Decreases in government spending will lower real interest rates and crowd in investment in the long run.\nThe adjustment model in this chapter helps us to understand the debate between Keynes and the classical economists.\nUsing monetary and fiscal policy in the short run to improve a politician’s reelection prospects may generate what is known as a political business cycle\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Check Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTax Increases and Crowding In. Using an aggregate demand and aggregate supply graph, show how tax increases for consumers today will eventually lead to lower interest rates and crowd in investment spending in the long run.\nEffects of Cross-Border Conflicts. Suppose that due to cross-border conflicts in an economy, domestic firms export less in order to meet the higher domestic consumption of goods. At the same time, the import of foreign goods increases. Assuming that the economy is initially at full employment and the exchange rate remains constant, what happens to the GDP in the short run and the long run?",

    "text": "A.10 Plotting Production Functions\nIn economics we often deal with multivariate functions such as utilty functions with more than one consumption input or production functions with more than just one factor of production. How can we plot such functions?\n\nA.10.1 Simple Production Function with one Input\nLet's try to plot production functions first. A production function relates economic inputs to economic outputs. Here is a simple production function relating labor hours with number of services produced:\n\\[y = F(n) = A \\times n^{0.5}\\]\nThe letter \\(y\\) is output and the letter \\(n\\) is labor measured in work hours. The letter \\(A\\) is total factor productivity (TFP) and is the \"level of technology\" that you have. Let's assume that the level of technology is \\(A=1\\). Now, let's plot this.\n\nA = 1\nnv = np.linspace(0,5,10)\nyv = A * nv**0.5\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(nv, yv, '-o')\nax.set_title('Output as function of labor input')\nax.set_xlabel('Labor $n$')\nax.set_ylabel('Output $y$')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us now calculate and then plot, the marginal product of labor (MPN), i.e., the extra output that one gets from adding a labor input. Mathematically, this means we take the derivative of the production function with respect to labor \\(n\\). This results in\n\\[y' = \\frac{\\partial F(n)}{\\partial n} = A \\times 0.5 \\times n ^{(0.5-1)}\\]\nWhich can also be rewritten as\n\\[y' = \\frac{\\partial F(n)}{\\partial n} = \\frac{0.5 \\times A}{n ^ {0.5}}\\]\nNext we again generate x and y values for this new function. Note that I start the x-grid at 0.5 and not at 0. Starting the grid at 0 would be problematic because you get a division by zero (which is infinity) error.\n\nA = 1\nnv = np.linspace(0.5,5,10)\nyv = A * 0.5 * nv**(0.5 - 1)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(nv, yv, '-o')\nax.set_title('Marginal product of labor')\nax.set_xlabel('Labor $n$')\nax.set_ylabel('Extra Output')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.10.2 Cobb-Douglas Production Functions with 2 Inputs\nFinally let's plot some Cobb-Douglas production functions. This is a very popular form of a production function in economics. It is a function that usually has two inputs, capital and labor.\n\\[y = F(k,n) = A \\times k^\\alpha n^{(1-\\alpha)}\\]\nThe letter \\(k\\) is capital, the letter \\(n\\) is labor, and \\(A\\) is again total factor productivity (TFP) i.e., the level of technology. The Greek symbol \\(\\alpha\\) is the factor share of capital in production. Just treat it as a constant for now.\nNow let's assume that you have the following given \\(A=1\\), \\(k=10\\), and \\(\\alpha = 0.3\\)\nLet us now plot this production with respect to changes in labor holding the above values constant.\n\nA = 1\nk = 10\nalpha = 0.3\nnv = np.linspace(0,5,10)\nyv = A * k**alpha * nv**(1-alpha)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(nv, yv, '-o')\nax.set_title('Cobb-Douglas function output')\nax.set_xlabel('Labor $n$')\nax.set_ylabel('Output $y$')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us again calculate and plot, the marginal product of labor, i.e., the extra output that one gets from adding a labor input. Mathematically, this means we take the derivative of the production function with respect to labor \\(n\\). This results in\n\\[y' = \\frac{\\partial F(k,n)}{\\partial n} = A \\times (1-\\alpha) \\times k^{\\alpha} \\times n ^{(1-\\alpha-1)}\\]\nWhich can also be rewritten as\n\\[y' = \\frac{\\partial F(k,n)}{\\partial n} = A \\times (1-\\alpha) \\times k^{\\alpha} \\times n ^{-\\alpha}\\]\n\\[y' = \\frac{\\partial F(k,n)}{\\partial n} = (1-\\alpha) \\times A \\times\n\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)^{\\alpha}\\]\nNext we again generate x and y values for this new function. Note that I start the x-grid at 0.5 and not at 0. Starting the grid at 0 would be problematic because you get a division by zero (which is infinity) error.\n\nA = 1\nalpha = 0.3\nnv = np.linspace(0,5,10)\nyv = (1-alpha) * A * k**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(nv, yv, '-o')\nax.set_title('Marginal product of labor')\nax.set_xlabel('Labor $n$')\nax.set_ylabel('Extra output')\nplt.show()\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_25658/3152989863.py:4: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in power\n  yv = (1-alpha) * A * k**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere you see the divide by zero warning I get because I started the x-grid at value zero. So the computer only plots 9 points this time and suppresses the first one that it cannot calculate.\nFinally, let's calculate the production function for different levels of capital. So we have, say, three different economies with capital stock \\(k_1=10\\), \\(k_2=15\\), and \\(k_3=20\\), respectively. Then let's plot output into a graph.\n\nA = 1\nk1 = 10\nk2 = 15\nk3 = 20\nalpha = 0.3\nnv = np.linspace(0,5,10)\ny1v = A * k1**alpha * nv**(1-alpha)\ny2v = A * k2**alpha * nv**(1-alpha)\ny3v = A * k3**alpha * nv**(1-alpha)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(nv, y1v, '-o', \\\n        nv, y2v, '-o', \\\n        nv, y3v, '-o')\nax.set_title('Cobb-Douglas function output')\nax.set_xlabel('Labor $n$')\nax.set_ylabel('Output $y$')\nax.legend(['$k_1=10$', '$k_2=15$', '$k_3=20$'], loc = 'best')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here are the marginal products of labor for the 3 economies. Note the warnings that Python spits out for the first point in the nv grid. This point is zero and the function itself has \\(nv^{(-alpha)}\\) which is \\(\\frac{1}{nv^\\alpha}\\) and therefore results in a division by zero.\n\nA = 1\nk1 = 10\nk2 = 15\nk3 = 20\nalpha = 0.3\nnv = np.linspace(0,5,10)\ny1v = (1.-alpha)* A * k1**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\ny2v = (1.-alpha)* A * k2**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\ny3v = (1.-alpha)* A * k3**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(nv, y1v, '-o', \\\n        nv, y2v, '-o', \\\n        nv, y3v, '-o')\nax.set_title('Marginal product of labor in Cobb-Douglas')\nax.set_xlabel('Labor $n$')\nax.set_ylabel('Output $y$')\nax.legend(['$k_1=10$', '$k_2=15$', '$k_3=20$'], loc = 'best')\nplt.show()\n\n/tmp/ipykernel_25658/362966397.py:7: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in power\n  y1v = (1.-alpha)* A * k1**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\n/tmp/ipykernel_25658/362966397.py:8: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in power\n  y2v = (1.-alpha)* A * k2**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\n/tmp/ipykernel_25658/362966397.py:9: RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in power\n  y3v = (1.-alpha)* A * k3**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not want to see these warnings you can start the nv grid with a small number, close to---but not equal to---zero. Note the change in the linspace command below.\n\nA = 1\nk1 = 10\nk2 = 15\nk3 = 20\nalpha = 0.3\nnv = np.linspace(0.01,5,10)\ny1v = (1.-alpha)* A * k1**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\ny2v = (1.-alpha)* A * k2**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\ny3v = (1.-alpha)* A * k3**alpha * nv**(-alpha)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(nv, y1v, '-o', \\\n        nv, y2v, '-o', \\\n        nv, y3v, '-o')\nax.set_title('Marginal product of labor in Cobb-Douglas')\nax.set_xlabel('Labor $n$')\nax.set_ylabel(r'MPN $\\rightarrow$ change in output')\nax.legend(['$k_1=10$', '$k_2=15$', '$k_3=20$'], loc = 'best')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet us now derive the derivative function of the production function, i.e., we calculate the second derivative with respect to labor:\n\\[Y = A F(k,n) = A \\times k^{\\alpha} \\times n ^{1-\\alpha}\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial F(k,n)}{\\partial n} = (1-\\alpha) \\times A \\times k^{\\alpha} \\times n ^{-\\alpha} &gt; 0\\]\n\\[\\frac{\\partial^2 F(k,n)}{\\partial n\\partial n} = (-\\alpha) (1-\\alpha) \\times A \\times  k^{\\alpha} \\times n ^{-\\alpha-1} &lt; 0\\]\nThe first derivative is positive and the second derivative is negative. The negative second derivative tells you that the increments in production (as measured by the first derivative) decrease at a smaller and smaller rate.\n\nA = 1\nk1 = 10\nk2 = 15\nk3 = 20\nalpha = 0.3\nnv = np.linspace(0.1, 5, 10)\ny1v = (-alpha) * (1.-alpha) * A * k1**alpha * nv**(-alpha-1.)\ny2v = (-alpha) * (1.-alpha) * A * k2**alpha * nv**(-alpha-1.)\ny3v = (-alpha) * (1.-alpha) * A * k3**alpha * nv**(-alpha-1.)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\nax.plot(nv, y1v, '-o', \\\n        nv, y2v, '-o', \\\n        nv, y3v, '-o')\nax.set_title(r'Second Derivative of MPN: $\\frac{\\partial^2 F(k,n)}{(\\partial n)^2}$')\nax.set_xlabel(r'Labor $n$')\nax.set_ylabel(r'$\\frac{\\partial^2F}{(\\partial n)^2}$')\nax.legend([r'$k_1=10$', r'$k_2=15$', r'$k_3=20$'], loc = 'best')\nplt.show()",

Recall that nominal GDP is defined as the quantity of every good or service produced multiplied by the price at which it was sold, summed up for all goods and services. In order to see how much production has actually increased, we need to extract the effects of higher prices on nominal GDP. This can be easily done, using the GDP deflator.\n\ndf_a[['GDP_Deflator']].loc['1960'::].plot(style = ['-'])\nplt.title('GDP-Deflator', fontsize=titleSize)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.2: GDP-Deflator is nominal GDP divided by real GDP\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP deflator is a price index measuring the average prices of all goods and services included in the economy. We explore price indices in detail and how they are computed in Inflation, but this definition will do in the context of this chapter. The data for the GDP deflator are given in the table above and are shown graphically in Figure A.2.\nFigure A.2 shows that the price level has risen dramatically since 1960. The price level in 2010 was almost six times higher than in 1960 (the deflator for 2010 was 110 versus a level of 19 in 1960). Clearly, much of the apparent growth in nominal GDP was due to inflation, not an actual change in the quantity of goods and services produced, in other words, not in real GDP. Recall that nominal GDP can rise for two reasons: an increase in output, and/or an increase in prices.\nWhat is needed is to extract the increase in prices from nominal GDP so as to measure only changes in output. After all, the dollars used to measure nominal GDP in 1960 are worth more than the inflated dollars of 1990—and the price index tells exactly how much more. This adjustment is easy to do if you understand that nominal measurements are in value terms, where\n\\[Value = Price \\times Quantity\\]\nor\n\\[Nominal\\ GDP = GDP\\ Deflator \\times Real\\ GDP\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMICRO EXAMPLE\nLet’s look at an example at the micro level. Suppose the t-shirt company, Coolshirts, sells 10 t-shirts at a price of $9 each.\n\\[ nominal\\ revenue\\ from\\ sale = Price \\times Quantity \\] \\[ = \\$9 \\times 10 \\] \\[ = \\$90 \\]\nThen Coolshirts real income is:\n\\[ real\\ income = \\frac{Nominal\\ revenue}{Price} \\] \\[ = \\frac{$90}{$9} = 10 \\]\nIn other words, when we compute “real” measurements we are trying to get at actual quantities, in this case, 10 t-shirts.\n\n\nWith GDP, it is just a tiny bit more complicated. We start with the same formula as above:\n\\[Real\\ GDP = \\frac{Nominal\\ GDP}{Price\\ Index}\\]\nFor reasons that will be explained in more detail below, mathematically, a price index is a two-digit decimal number like 1.00 or 0.85 or 1.25. Because some people have trouble working with decimals, when the price index is published, it has traditionally been multiplied by 100 to get integer numbers like 100, 85, or 125. What this means is that when we “deflate” nominal figures to get real figures (by dividing the nominal by the price index). We also need to remember to divide the published price index by 100 to make the math work.\nSo the formula becomes:\n\\[Real\\ GDP = \\frac{Nominal\\ GDP}{Price\\ Index /100} \\] \\[ = \\frac{Nominal\\ GDP}{Price\\ Index} \\times 100\\]\n\ndf_q[['GDP', 'rGDP']].plot(style = ['-', '--'])\nplt.title('Nominal and Real US-GDP (2012 Base Year)' , fontsize=titleSize)\nplt.ylabel('in Billion US $')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.3: Nominal and real GDP.

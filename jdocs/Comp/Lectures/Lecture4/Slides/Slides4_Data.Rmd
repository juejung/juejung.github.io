# Import data and standard statistics functionality

Data can be found in many formats. Once standard format of data is "comma separated values" or .csv files. This type of file is very common because ***Microsoft Excel*** can easily read and write data in this simple text file format.
So whenever you find data you can try to convert it into Excel format. There are many free programs that transform data from various data base formats into an Excel readable format. Once you have data in Excel format, simply go to the ***File*** menue and choose ***save as***. Here you can choose the file format. Choose .csv files and save your data under some name, i.e. someName.csv

You can then import this .csv file into R and Python, which is what we do next. For this purpose I have prepared 2 different data files with the following names: 
  - [Lecture_3_Excel_a.csv](Lecture_4_Excel_a.csv)
  - [Lecture_3_Excel_b.csv](Lecture_4_Excel_b.csv)

As you can see, these files have already been saved as comma separated files. You can open any of these files with a simple text editor and have a first look.

I next provide two sets of lecture notes, one for R and one for Python. They pretty much accomplish the same thing, but since this lecture is a bit longer than the others, I want to keep the two versions separate:
  - [Slides_R](Slides4_Data_R.html)
  - [Slides_Py](Slides4_Data_Python.html)

# Homework 10: Cake eating

Submit this homework in class on Tuesday.
I need two files:

  * R-scripts are submitted in one file called: ``Homework10.R``
  * Python-scripts are submitted in one file called: ``Homework10.py``

I need to be able to quickly run these scripts on my computer.

I will based your homework grade on my grading of 2 randomly selected homework exercises. So please make sure that you complete every homework 100% as you might otherwise end up with zero points.

Implement all exercises in **R** and **Python**!

## Exercise 1

Check Appendix A in our Python book (Langtangen (2012)). Determine the limit of a sequence. Given the sequence:

$$ a_n = \frac{7 + 1/n}{3 - 1/n^2},$$

make a program that computes and prints out $a_n$ for $n = 1,2,\dots, N$. Read N from the command line. Does $a_n$ approach a finite limit when $n \rightarrow 8$?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Exercise 2


Determine the limit of a sequence when the sequence of interest is given by:

$$ D_n = \frac{sin(2^{-n})}{2^{-n}}.$$

## Exercise 3

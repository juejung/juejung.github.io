"""Game of life in Python with numpy tricks for compuational efficiency.

Note: the program does not show any output, but simply makes a series
of png images, one for each step. For example, if you have the
ImageMagick program installed, type 'animate -delay 100 life*png' to
see a movie with delay of 100ms between framew.

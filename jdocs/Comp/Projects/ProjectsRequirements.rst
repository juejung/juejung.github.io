CompEcon: Project Requirements 
===============================================================================

 *  I reserve 2 lectures
    for project presentations. You have 15 minutes for your final presentation.
    Your presentation will be graded using the following 
    `rubic <https://juejung.github.io/jdocs/Comp/Projects/GradingRubric.pptx>`_

 *  Proofread your paper!

 *  Make sure that your codes are well documented before you upload them into your
    projects repositories. 

 *  Also make sure that you don't have unnecessary code
    repetitions that could have been inside of a loop. You will lose points if 
    I see a lot of that.

*   For citations use the author-year style. 
  		Example: Brown and Sorger (2005) show that something is very important ...

*   In the reference section (or bibliography) then have the article listed as:
        Brown, Jerry and Brian Sorger (2005), "The Macroeconomics of This and
        That," *Economic Journal of Something*, Vol. 17, 2, p. 333-335.

 *  Make sure that all tables and figures are relatively self contained. At a
    minimum this means that every table and figure should have a label that
    looks something like this::

        Table 1: Sample of Prices over Time
        Source: Survey xyz

 *  Similarly for figures::

        Figure 1: Price Trends for Tomatoes

    The label can be on top or at the bottom of the table or figure - be consistent
    with the placement though.

 *  Finally, make sure that you adhere to the outline described in the Project
   Hints (previous link) when you write your paper (15-20 pages).

 * The title page should have the title, authors, date,  an abstract etc. on it.
   Check any one of my papers from my 
   `research website <https://juejung.github.io/research.htm>`_
   for a template.

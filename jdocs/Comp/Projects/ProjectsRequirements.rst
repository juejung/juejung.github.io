===============================================================================
Project Requirements for Econ 470
===============================================================================

 *  The due date for your projects is **Thursday, May 7** in class.
 *  You have to submit the following:
        1. Electronic version of the paper in pdf or word format.
        2. Paper version of the paper
        3. Electronic version of the presentation in pdf or Powerpoint format.
        4. Paper version of the presentation (you can print 4 slides per paper,
           there's no need to color print or bind it etc. Just hand it
           a plain black and white printed presentation.)
        5. Python codes pushed into your project repository on GitHub.
        6. A printed and filled out version of the team self-evaluation rubik
           that you can find 
           `here <https://juejung.github.io/jdocs/Comp/Projects/TeamGradingRubric.pptx>`_.
           Each team member has to fill this out! If you are a one person team
           you can ignore this!
                   
 *  May 7 is also the first day of your final presentation. I reserve 2 lectures
    for this, May 12 is the other day. You have 15 minutes for your final presentation.
    Your presentation will be graded using the following 
    `rubic <https://juejung.github.io/jdocs/Comp/Projects/GradingRubric.pptx>`_

 *  Proofread your paper!

 *  Make sure that your codes are well documented before you upload them into your
    projects repositories. 

 *  Also make sure that you don't have unnecessary code
    repetitions that could have been inside of a loop. You will lose points if 
    I see a lot of that.

 *  Make sure that all tables and figures are relatively self contained. At a
    minimum this means that every table and figure should have a label that
    looks something like this::

        Table 1: Sample of Prices over Time
        Source: Survey xyz

 *  Similarly for figures::

        Figure 1: Price Trends for Tomatoes

    The label can be on top or at the bottom of the table or figure - be consistent
    with the placement though.

 *  Finally, make sure that you adhere to the following outline when you write your paper
    (15-20 pages).

 * The title page should have the title, authors, date,  an abstract etc. on it.
   Check any one of my papers from my 
   `research website <https://juejung.github.io/research.htm>`_
   for a template.

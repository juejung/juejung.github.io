CompEcon: Project Requirements 
===============================================================================

*  I reserve 3 lectures
   for project presentations. You have 15 minutes for your final presentation.
   Your presentation will be graded using the following 
   `rubic <https://juejung.github.io/jdocs/Comp/Projects/GradingRubric.pptx>`_

*  Proofread your paper!

*  Make sure that your codes are well documented before you upload them into your
   projects repositories. 

*  Also make sure that you don't have unnecessary code
   repetitions that could have been inside of a loop. You will lose points if 
   I see a lot of that.

*  For citations use the author-year style. 
 		Example: Brown and Sorger (2005) show that something is very important ...

*  In the reference section (or bibliography) then have the article listed as:
       Brown, Jerry and Brian Sorger (2005), "The Macroeconomics of This and
       That," *Economic Journal of Something*, Vol. 17, 2, p. 333-335.

*  Make sure that all tables and figures are relatively self contained. At a
   minimum this means that every table and figure should have a label that
   looks something like this::

       Table 1: Sample of Prices over Time

       --> Table goes here
       
       Source: Survey xyz

*  Similarly for figures::

        --> Figure goes here

        Figure 1: Price Trends for Tomatoes
        Notes: Source of data is bla bla

*  The label/title for tables typcially goes on top whereas the lable/title for figures
    typically follows the figure at the bottom.

*  Notes to table or figures are usually placed at the bottom.

*  Finally, make sure that you adhere to the outline described in the Project
   Hints (previous link) when you write your paper (15-20 pages).

* The **title page** should have the 
    * title, 
    * authors and affiliation,
    * date,  
    * an abstract,
    * JEL codes, and
    * Keywords

   Check any one of my papers from my 
   `research website <https://juejung.github.io/research.htm>`_
   for a template.

* JEL code information can be found here: `JEL codes <https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/jelCodes.php>`_
  They classify the research within the field of economics.

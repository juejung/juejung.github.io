CompEcon: Project Requirements 
===============================================================================

Please read the 2 documents **Project Ideas** and **Tips for
Successful Research Projects** that are posted on Blackboard, right below this document. 

Project Submission
===============================================================================

The project submission/grade is broken into 4 parts or stages:
Each part/stage has its own due date. Please read the schedule (posted on
Blackboard) for the relevant due dates.

1. **Stage 1: Research Idea** 

   * Submit a one page summary of your project. Include a title, two
     paragraphs of descriptions of your research question, data source and/or
     method you plan on using. This would either describe the data and where you
     plan on getting it (e.g., download survey data, scrape data from a website,
     use an API to download data, etc.). Then add 3 sources that are closely tied
     to your project. Use an econ paper search engine such as Google Scholar or 
     `Repec <https://econpapers.repec.org/scripts/search.pf?ft=>`_

   * This submission happens via Dropbox. Under the projects folder put the
     relevant files into the subfolder called **stage-1**.

2. **Stage 2: Show Progress** 

   * Submit a rough first draft of the paper. This includes some preliminary
     graphs or tables, maybe some codes that you have written.

   * This submission happens via Dropbox. Under the projects folder put the
     relevant files into the subfolder called **stage-2**. 


3. **Stage 3: Submit Final Paper + Codes** 

   * Submit the final paper. 20 pages, double spaced. The 20 pages include
     everything (e.g., references, graphs, tables). That usually means about 11-12
     pages of written text. **Follow instructions on paper outline below.**

   * This submission happens via Dropbox. Under the projects folder put the
     relevant files into the subfolder called **stage-3-paper**. 

4. **Stage 4: Presentation + Slides** 

   * Give a 10-15 minutes presentation of your project. Submit the slides (in pdf
     format) on the due date on the schedule. I will upload the presentations on 
     Blackboard so you can easily access your slides for the presentation.
   * **Follow instructions on good slides** posted on Blackboard and make about
     10! slides.

   * This submission happens via Dropbox. Under the projects folder add
     the relevant files (pdf or PowerPoint) into the subfolder called **stage-4-presentation**. 

   * I reserve 3 lectures for project presentations. You have 15 minutes for
     your final presentation.  Your presentation will be graded using the
     following

Paper
===============================================================================

* The structure of your paper (about 20 pages) will roughly follow this outline:

  0. Title page
  1. Introduction (with literature review)
  2. Model (Econometric model, e.g., :math:`y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon`)
  3. Data (Description of data survey and summary stats)
  4. Results (Regression analysis etc.)
  5. Conclusion

  * References
  * Appendix: Tables
  * Appendix: Figures

* If your project is based on model based simulation, the structure is slightly different:

  0. Title page
  1. Introduction (with literature review)
  2. Model
  3. Equilibrium
  3. Results (Simulation of policy experiments, etc.)
  4. Conclusion

  * References
  * Appendix: Tables
  * Appendix: Figures

* The **title page** should have the 
    * title, 
    * authors and affiliation,
    * date,  
    * an abstract,
    * JEL codes, and
    * Keywords

   Check any one of my papers from my 
   `research website <https://juejung.github.io/research.htm>`_
   for a template.

* JEL code information can be found here: `JEL codes <https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/jelCodes.php>`_
  They classify the research within the field of economics.


*  For citations use the author-year style. 
 		Example: Brown and Sorger (2005) show that something is very important ...

*  In the reference section (or bibliography) then have the article listed as:
       Brown, Jerry and Brian Sorger (2005), "The Macroeconomics of This and
       That," *Economic Journal of Something*, Vol. 17, 2, p. 333-335.

*  Make sure that all tables and figures are relatively self contained. At a
   minimum this means that every table and figure should have a label that
   looks something like this::

       Table 1: Sample of Prices over Time

       --> Table goes here
       
       Source: Survey xyz

*  Similarly for figures::

        --> Figure goes here

        Figure 1: Price Trends for Tomatoes
        Notes: Source of data is bla bla

*  The label/title for tables typically goes on top whereas the label/title for
   figures typically follows the figure at the bottom.

*  Notes to table or figures are usually placed at the bottom.

*  Finally, make sure that you adhere to the outline described in the Project
   Hints (previous link) when you write your paper (15-20 pages).

*  **Proofread your paper!**

*  Now **proofread it again!**

Codes
===============================================================================
*  Make sure that your codes are well documented before you upload them into your
   projects repositories. 

*  Also make sure that you don't have unnecessary code
   repetitions that could have been inside of a loop. You will lose points if 
   I see a lot of that.

*  Make sure the codes runs through without any syntax errors! You lose points
   if the code breaks.

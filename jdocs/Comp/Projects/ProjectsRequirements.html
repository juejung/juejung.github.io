</header>
<p>Please read the 2 documents <strong>Project Ideas</strong> and <strong>Tips for Successful Research Projects</strong> that are posted on Blackboard, right below this document.</p>
<h1 id="project-submission">Project Submission</h1>
<p>The project submission/grade is broken into 4 parts or stages: Each part/stage has its own due date. Please read the schedule (posted on Blackboard) for the relevant due dates.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Stage 1: Research Idea</strong>
<ul>
<li>Submit a one page summary of your project. Include a title, two paragraphs of descriptions of your research question, data source and/or method you plan on using. This would either describe the data and where you plan on getting it (e.g., download survey data, scrape data from a website, use an API to download data, etc.). Then add 3 sources that are closely tied to your project. Use an econ paper search engine such as Google Scholar or <a href="https://econpapers.repec.org/scripts/search.pf?ft=">Repec</a></li>
<li>This submission happens via Dropbox. Under the projects folder put the relevant files into the subfolder called <strong>stage-1</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stage 2: Show Progress</strong>
<ul>
<li>Submit a rough first draft of the paper. This includes some preliminary graphs or tables, maybe some codes that you have written.</li>
<li>This submission happens via Dropbox. Under the projects folder put the relevant files into the subfolder called <strong>stage-2</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stage 3: Submit Final Paper + Codes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Submit the final paper. 20 pages, double spaced. The 20 pages include everyting (e.g., references, graphs, tables). That usually means about 11-12 pages of written text. <strong>Follow instructions on paper outline below.</strong></li>
<li>This submission happens via Dropbox. Under the projects folder put the relevant files into the subfolder called <strong>stage-3-paper</strong>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Stage 4: Presentation + Slides</strong>
<ul>
<li>Give a 10-15 minutes presentation of you project. Submit the slides (in pdf format) the day before the presentation so I can upload them. <strong>Follow instructions on good slides</strong> posted on Blackboard.</li>
<li>This submission happens via Dropbox. Under the projects folder add put the relevant files into the subfolder called <strong>stage-4-presentation</strong>.</li>
<li>I reserve 3 lectures for project presentations. You have 15 minutes for your final presentation. Your presentation will be graded using the following <a href="https://juejung.github.io/jdocs/Comp/Projects/GradingRubric.pptx">rubic</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="paper">Paper</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>The structure of your paper (about 20 pages) will roughly follow this outline:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Title page</li>
<li>Introduction (with literature review)</li>
<li>Model (Econometric model, e.g., <span class="math inline"><em>y</em> = <em>β</em><sub>0</sub> + <em>β</em><sub>1</sub><em>X</em> + <em>ϵ</em></span>)</li>
<li>Data (Description of data survey and summary stats)</li>
<li>Results (Regression analysis etc.)</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>References</li>
<li>Appendix: Tables</li>
<li>Appendix: Figures</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If your project is based on model based simulation, the structure is slightly different:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Title page</li>
<li>Introduction (with literature review)</li>
<li>Model</li>
<li>Equilibrium</li>
<li>Results (Simulation of policy experiments, etc.)</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>References</li>
<li>Appendix: Tables</li>
<li>Appendix: Figures</li>
</ul></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>The <strong>title page</strong> should have the</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>title,</li>
<li>authors and affiliation,</li>
<li>date,</li>
<li>an abstract,</li>
<li>JEL codes, and</li>
<li>Keywords</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Check any one of my papers from my</dt>
<dd><p><a href="https://juejung.github.io/research.htm">research website</a> for a template.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li>JEL code information can be found here: <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/econlit/jelCodes.php">JEL codes</a> They classify the research within the field of economics.</li>
<li><dl>
<dt>For citations use the author-year style.</dt>
<dd><p>Example: Brown and Sorger (2005) show that something is very important ...</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><dl>
<dt>In the reference section (or bibliography) then have the article listed as:</dt>
<dd><p>Brown, Jerry and Brian Sorger (2005), "The Macroeconomics of This and That," <em>Economic Journal of Something</em>, Vol. 17, 2, p. 333-335.</p>
</dd>
</dl></li>
<li><p>Make sure that all tables and figures are relatively self contained. At a minimum this means that every table and figure should have a label that looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code>Table 1: Sample of Prices over Time

--&gt; Table goes here

Source: Survey xyz</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Similarly for figures:</p>
<pre><code>--&gt; Figure goes here

Figure 1: Price Trends for Tomatoes
Notes: Source of data is bla bla</code></pre></li>
<li>The label/title for tables typically goes on top whereas the label/title for figures typically follows the figure at the bottom.</li>
<li>Notes to table or figures are usually placed at the bottom.</li>
<li>Finally, make sure that you adhere to the outline described in the Project Hints (previous link) when you write your paper (15-20 pages).</li>
<li><strong>Proofread your paper!</strong></li>
<li>Now <strong>proofread it again!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="codes">Codes</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your codes are well documented before you upload them into your projects repositories.</li>
<li>Also make sure that you don't have unnecessary code repetitions that could have been inside of a loop. You will lose points if I see a lot of that.</li>
<li>Make sure the codes runs through without any syntax errors! You lose points if the code breaks.</li>
</ul>

Suggested Projects for Econ 470
===============================

You are encouraged to come up with your own project ideas. If you have
trouble with that, you can use some of these suggestions to get you
started on a project.

1. Network graphs
-----------------

Use `iGraph <http://igraph.sourceforge.net/index.html>`_ 
to analyze network data. Some network data can be found under this
`link <http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/>`_.

2. Data analysis
----------------

Use data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
`MEPS <http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/>`__ and analyze health state transition
probabilities over the life-cycle of individuals. This is 
a data project that will require deepening your knowledge of the **Pandas**
library. You are required to download the
data, transform it into Python readable files, clean it, and produce graphs
and summary statistics. 
If you already took Econometric you can try to implement ``mlogit`` or ``mprobit`` models.

  * Literature to get you started: 
    `Jung (2015) <https://juejung.github.io/papers/markovtransitions.pdf>`_
  * Data: `MEPS <http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/>`_

3. Tax simulation policy
------------------------

Simulate optimal tax policy in an overlapping generations economy. This
is probably a Python project as it deals with optimization methods. 

  * Literature to get you started: 
    `Glomm and Jung (2013) <https://juejung.github.io/papers/timing05142012.pdf>`_
  * Codes:

4. Data visualization using ggplot
-----------------------------------

Data visualization project using `ggplot <http://ggplot.yhathq.com/>`_ 

  * Literature to get you started: 
  * Data:

5. GUI programming
------------------

GUI programming in Python using
`tkinter <https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/tkinter.html>`_

  * Literature to get you started:

6. Object oriented programming
------------------------------

Agent-based modeling using `simPy <http://simpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ in
Python. This requires object-oriented-programming 

  * Literature to get you started:

        Efficiency of Markets with Zero-Intelligence Traders: Market as a
        Partial Substitute for Individual Rationality," Journal of Political
        Economy Vol. 101, No. 1, pp. 119-137
